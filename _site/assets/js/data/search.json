    "content": "How to Install Cygwin on Windows and Add the Rsync PackageIf you’re a Windows user and want to access Linux-like tools and packages, Cygwin is a great solution. Cygwin provides a large collection of GNU and Open Source tools, which offer a Linux-like environment on Windows. One such tool is rsync, a powerful utility for file synchronization.In this post, we’ll walk through the installation process of Cygwin on Windows and how to add the rsync package.Step 1: Download the Cygwin InstallerFirst, you’ll need to download the official Cygwin setup package from the Cygwin website.  Navigate to the Cygwin download page and download the setup executable file. It will be named something like setup-x86_64.exe for 64-bit systems.Step 2: Run the Cygwin Setup WizardOnce you have the setup file downloaded, double-click on it to run the Cygwin Setup Wizard.Step 3: Choose Installation Method  When the setup wizard opens, select Install from Internet and click Next.  This option allows Cygwin to download the necessary files from the internet.Step 4: Select Installation Location  Next, you’ll be prompted to select the location where you want to install Cygwin. By default, it installs on your C: drive (C:\\cygwin64), but you can change the location if you’d prefer to install it on a different drive, like your E: drive.  Choose the installation directory and click Next.Step 5: Select Local Package Directory  Now, you’ll need to select a Local Package Directory where the downloaded Cygwin packages will be stored temporarily. For example, you can use your E: drive or any other directory.  After selecting the directory, click Next.Step 6: Choose Internet Connectivity  Select the Direct Connection option for internet connectivity.  If you have a proxy server, you can configure it here, but for most home users, the direct connection will work fine.  Click Next.Step 7: Select Download Mirror  Choose a Download Site. Cygwin will provide a list of mirrors. You can select the mirror closest to your location. I used cygwin.mirror.constant.com for this tutorial.  Click Next.Step 8: Download Cygwin PackagesOnce you’ve selected a mirror, Cygwin will begin downloading the necessary setup files. This process may take a few minutes, depending on your internet connection speed.Step 9: Select Packages to Install  After the download finishes, the setup wizard will ask you to select the packages you want to install.  In this case, we want to install the rsync package. To do this:          In the package list, use the search bar at the top and search for rsync.      Under the “Net” category, locate the rsync package.      Click on the “Skip” label next to rsync to select it for installation (it will change to show the version number).      Step 10: Begin Installation  After selecting rsync and any other packages you wish to install, click Next.  The setup will start installing Cygwin and the selected packages, including rsync.Step 11: Complete the InstallationOnce the installation process is complete, the wizard will prompt you to click Finish.Step 12: Open the Cygwin TerminalAfter the installation is finished, you can access your Linux-like environment by opening the Cygwin Terminal. It should be available from the Start Menu under Cygwin or simply by searching for Cygwin Terminal.To verify that rsync was installed correctly, open the Cygwin terminal and type the following command:rsync -VIf the installation was successful, you should see information about the installed version of rsync.ConclusionNow you have successfully installed Cygwin on your Windows machine and added the rsync package. You can use Cygwin to access a Linux-like environment and use various Linux tools like rsync directly on your Windows machine.With Cygwin, you can take advantage of powerful Unix utilities like rsync, making it easier to manage files and data between your Windows system and other Linux systems."

Whether you’re looking to break into the world of cybersecurity or deepen your existing knowledge, OverTheWire provides a wealth of challenges to help you sharpen your skills.This is a continuation from Part 2 of the Bandit Wargame series. If you haven’t checked out Part 1 blog, I highly recommend giving it a read before proceeding, as it covers foundational skills essential for tackling these levels.Now, let’s pick up where we left off and dive deeper into the challenges, starting from Bandit Level 11. These levels will introduce more advanced concepts, helping you sharpen your Linux skills further. Let’s get started!Bandit Level 11 → Level 12Level GoalThe password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positionsbandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txtGur cnffjbeq vf 7k16JArUVv5LxVuJfsSVdbbtaHGlw9D4bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'The password is 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4bandit11@bandit:~$Explanaitonthe tr (translate) command in Linux or Unix-like systems to perform a character-by-character transformation of text. Specifically, this command implements the ROT13 cipher for encoding or decoding text.ROT13 (short for “rotate by 13 places”) is a simple letter substitution cipher used primarily for obscuring text. It replaces each letter of the alphabet with the letter 13 positions ahead of it. Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, applying ROT13 twice (rotating 13 positions forward and then 13 positions back) restores the original text.For example:  “A” becomes “N”  “B” becomes “O”  “C” becomes “P”  “Z” becomes “M”The beauty of ROT13 is its simplicity. It is often used in online forums or email to obscure spoilers, puzzle answers, or sensitive information, as it does not provide real encryption but just hides the content in plain view.Bandit Level 12 → Level 13Level GoalThe password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)bandit12@bandit:~$ mktemp -d/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ekbandit12@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ekbandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ cp ~/data.txt .bandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ xxd -r data.txt binarybandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ lsbinary  data.txtbandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ file binarybinary: gzip compressed data, was \"data2.bin\", last modified: Thu Sep 19 07:08:15 2024, max compression, from Unix, original size modulo 2^32 574bandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ mv binary binary.gzbandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ gzip -d binary.gzbandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ lsbinary  data.txtbandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ file binarybinary: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900kbandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ mv binary binary.bz2bandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ bzip2 -d binary.bz2bandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ file binarybinary: gzip compressed data, was \"data4.bin\", last modified: Thu Sep 19 07:08:15 2024, max compression, from Unix, original size modulo 2^32 20480bandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ mv binary binary.gzbandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ gzip -d binary.gzbandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ file binarybinary: POSIX tar archive (GNU)bandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ tar -xf binarybandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ lsbinary  data5.bin  data.txtbandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ file data5.bindata5.bin: POSIX tar archive (GNU)bandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ tar -xf data5.binbandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ lsbinary  data5.bin  data6.bin  data.txtbandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ file data6.bindata6.bin: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900kbandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ mv data6.bin data6.bz2bandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ bzip2 -d data6.bz2bandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ lsbinary  data5.bin  data6  data.txtbandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ file data6data6: POSIX tar archive (GNU)bandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ tar -xf data6bandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ lsbinary  data5.bin  data6  data8.bin  data.txtbandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ file data8.bindata8.bin: gzip compressed data, was \"data9.bin\", last modified: Thu Sep 19 07:08:15 2024, max compression, from Unix, original size modulo 2^32 49bandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ mv data8.bin data8.gzbandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ gzip -d data8.gzbandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ lsbinary  data5.bin  data6  data8  data.txtbandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ file data8data8: ASCII textbandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ cat data8The password is FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAnExplanation  Create a temp directory using mktemp -d, copy data.txt into it and reverse the hex dump with xxd -r to get the binary file.  Identify the file type with file and decompress or extract it repeatedly based on its format:          For gzip: Rename with .gz and decompress using gzip -d.      For bzip2: Rename with .bz2 and decompress using bzip2 -d.      For tar archives: Extract using tar -xf.        Repeat the process (analyzing and decompressing/extracting) until reaching the final file.  Read the final ASCII text file using cat, which revealed the passwordBandit Level 13 → Level 14Level GoalThe password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14.

The file command identifies it as a setuid ELF executable, meaning it runs with the permissions of its owner.  Executing ./bandit20-do without any arguments provides information that it allows running commands as another user.  The command ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20 is used to read the password for the next level, bandit20, successfully retrieving the required password."

By default, grep will print a message like “binary file matches” when it encounters binary data, and it won’t show matching lines. The -a option overrides this behavior, allowing grep to search through binary files as if they were text and display matching lines.Key Points:  Default behavior: grep skips binary files and shows “binary file matches” without displaying the match.  With -a: grep processes binary files as text and shows matching lines.  Use case: Useful when you want to search for text in files containing binary data.Bandit Level 10 → Level 11Level GoalThe password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded databandit10@bandit:~$ lsdata.txtbandit10@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | grep -a [a-zA-Z0-9]VGhlIHBhc3N3b3JkIGlzIGR0UjE3M2ZaS2IwUlJzREZTR3NnMlJXbnBOVmozcVJyCg==bandit10@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | grep -a [a-zA-Z0-9] | base64 -dThe password is dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRrbandit10@bandit:~$Explanation:  cat data.txt: Reads the content of data.txt.  grep -a [a-zA-Z0-9]: Filters lines that contain alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers), ignoring others. The -a option ensures binary data is treated as text.  base64 -d: Decodes the alphanumeric text, assuming it is Base64-encoded, back to its original form.If data.txt contains mixed content where some lines are Base64-encoded, this command extracts the encoded lines, decodes them, and shows the original data.These first 10 challenges provide a strong starting point for tackling bandit but there’s more to explore!In the next blog We’ll dive into challenges 11 to 20 and share more practical solutions to help you move forward.

    "content": "LXConsole is an open-source web-based application designed to simplify the management of LXD servers. It offers a convenient graphical user interface that allows users to manage multiple Incus (LXD’s fork) and LXD containers. In this blog, we will guide you through the entire process of setting up and using LXConsole, from launching a Debian instance to managing LXD containers seamlessly through a web interface.Stpe1: Launching the Debian instanceTo begin with, you need a Debian instance. This can be easily achieved using Proxmox helper scripts. These scripts automate the setup process, saving you time and effort. To launch the Debian instance, execute the following command:bash -c \"$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/raw/main/ct/debian.sh)\"This command will download and execute a script that sets up a Debian container on your Proxmox environment. After running the script, you should have a Debian instance ready for further configuration.    ____       __    _   / __ \\___  / /_  (_)___ _____  / / / / _ \\/ __ \\/ / __ `/ __ \\ / /_/ /  __/ /_/ / / /_/ / / / //_____/\\___/_.___/_/\\__,_/_/ /_/  🧩  Using Advanced Settings  🖥️   Operating System: debian  🌟  Version: 12  📦  Container Type: Privileged  🔐  Root Password: ********  🆔  Container ID: XXX  🏠  Hostname: lxconsole  💾  Disk Size: 2  🧠  CPU Cores: 1  🛠️   RAM Size: 512  🌉  Bridge: vmbr0  📡  IP Address: XXXXXXXXXX  🌐  Gateway IP Address: XXXXXXXXXX  📡  APT-Cacher IP Address: Default  🚫  Disable IPv6: no  ⚙️   Interface MTU Size: Default  🔍  DNS Search Domain: Host  📡  DNS Server IP Address: Host  🏷️   Vlan: Default  🔑  Root SSH Access: yes  🔍  Verbose Mode: yes  🚀  Creating a Debian LXC using the above advanced settings  ✔️   Using XXXXXXXXXX for Template Storage.  ✔️   Using XXXXXXXXXX for Container Storage.  ✔️   Updated LXC Template List  ✔️   LXC Container XXX was successfully created.  ✔️   Started LXC Container  ✔️   Set up Container OS  ✔️   Network Connected: XXXXXXXXXX  ✔️   IPv4 Internet Connected  ✖️   IPv6 Internet Not Connected  ✔️   DNS Resolved github.com to XXXX:XXXX:XXXX::XXXX:XXXX  ✔️   Updated Container OS  ✔️   Installed Dependencies  ✔️   Cleaned  ✔️   Completed Successfully!  🚀  Debian setup has been successfully initialized!Step2: Configuring the LXconsoleOnce your server has booted and is running, you can connect to the server and start configuring LXConsole. To do this, use the LXC console to access your Debian server.❯ lxc-console XXXConnected to tty 1Type &lt;Ctrl+a q&gt; to exit the console, &lt;Ctrl+a Ctrl+a&gt; to enter Ctrl+a itselflxconsole login: lxconsole login: rootPassword: Debian LXC Container    🖥️    OS: Debian GNU/Linux - Version: 12    🏠   Hostname: lxconsole    💡   IP Address: XXXXXXXXXXroot@lxconsole:~# Next, install essential packages such as Git, Python 3, and Pip to prepare the environment for LXConsole:sudo apt install git python3 python3-pipOnce these packages are installed, clone the LXConsole repository from GitHub and install the necessary requirements:root@lxconsole:~# git clone https://github.com/PenningLabs/lxconsole.gitCloning into 'lxconsole'...remote: Enumerating objects: 3258, done.remote: Counting objects: 100% (797/797), done.remote: Compressing objects: 100% (287/287), done.remote: Total 3258 (delta 573), reused 719 (delta 500), pack-reused 2461 (from 1)Receiving objects: 100% (3258/3258), 22.76 MiB | 4.03 MiB/s, done.Resolving deltas: 100% (1143/1143), done.root@lxconsole:~# cd lxconsole &amp;&amp; pip3 install -r requirements.txtOnce the installation is complete, run LXConsole by executing the run.py file:python3 run.pyStep3: Creating the systemd fileTo ensure LXConsole starts automatically when the system boots up, you need to create a systemd service file. This will configure LXConsole to launch as a service during system startup.First, create the service file with the following command:touch /etc/systemd/system/lxconsole.serviceNext, add the following content to the file using you favourite editor or choice (eg: nano, vim) making sure to update the paths according to your environment:[Unit]Description=LXConsoleAfter=network.target[Service]Type=simpleUser=$USERWorkingDirectory=/location/to/gitclone/lxconsole/ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /location/to/gitclone/lxconsole/run.pyRestart=on-failure[Install]WantedBy=multi-user.targetAfter saving the file, reload the systemd daemon to apply the changes and start the LXConsole service:systemctl daemon-reloadsystemctl restart lxconsole.serviceThis ensures that LXConsole will run on startup and be ready to manage your LXD containers.Step4: Installing the lxdIf you dont have lxd server preconfigured you can install the lxd server by using the following stepsAs we are using the debian operating system debain has the apt package manager we use the apt package manager to install the lxd and initilaze itsudo apt-get install lxdlxd initDuring the initialization process, you will be prompted with a series of questions to configure LXD. Here’s a sample of what the configuration might look like:root@lxconsole:~/lxd# lxd initWould you like to use LXD clustering? (yes/no) [default=no]: Do you want to configure a new storage pool? (yes/no) [default=yes]: Name of the new storage pool [default=default]: lxdpoolWould you like to connect to a MAAS server? (yes/no) [default=no]: Would you like to create a new local network bridge? (yes/no) [default=yes]: What should the new bridge be called? [default=lxdbr0]: What IPv4 address should be used? (CIDR subnet notation, “auto” or “none”) [default=auto]: What IPv6 address should be used? (CIDR subnet notation, “auto” or “none”) [default=auto]: Would you like the LXD server to be available over the network? (yes/no) [default=no]: yesAddress to bind LXD to (not including port) [default=all]: Port to bind LXD to [default=8443]: Trust password for new clients: Again: Would you like stale cached images to be updated automatically? (yes/no) [default=yes]: Would you like a YAML \"lxd init\" preseed to be printed? (yes/no) [default=no]: root@lxconsole:~/lxd#Once you complete the configuration, LXD will be set up and ready to use.Step5: Accessing the lxconsoleNow that LXConsole is installed and running, you can access the web-based user interface. Open your browser and navigate to:http://$SERVER_IP:5000During the first boot of LXConsole, you will be prompted to register and log in with your credentials.Step6: Adding the lxd server to the lxconsoleOnce you loged in add the existing lxd container to the lxconsole to connect and manage the lxd conatiners                               Before adding the server to the lxconsole we need to add the client trusted certicateroot@lxconsole:~/lxd# nano lxconsole.crtroot@lxconsole:~/lxd# lxc config trust add lxconsole.crtroot@lxconsole:~/lxd# lxc config set core.https_address [::]Once the server is added successfully, you can begin managing your LXD containers and virtual machines via LXConsole.step7: Launching the lxd container (alpine)As we have configured lxd and lxconsole lets launch the alpine lxd container. Start by searching for available LXD images Then, launch a container using a specific image by executing the following command for example, to launch an Alpine Linux container, you can use:lxc image list imageslxc launch images:{distro}/{version}/{arch} {container-name-here}lxc info {distro}root@lxconsole:~/lxd# lxc image list images: | grep alpine | grep x86_64 | grep -i container| alpine/3.17 (3 more)                     | 25716e82c54e | yes    | Alpine 3.17 amd64 (20241218_0021)         | x86_64       | CONTAINER       | 2.94MB    | Dec 18, 2024 at 12:00am (UTC) || alpine/3.17/cloud (1 more)               | 0ffc7b828a14 | yes    | Alpine 3.17 amd64 (20241218_0021)         | x86_64       | CONTAINER       | 19.49MB   | Dec 18, 2024 at 12:00am (UTC) || alpine/3.18 (3 more)                     | 2dac80bf43a5 | yes    | Alpine 3.18 amd64 (20241218_0022)         | x86_64       | CONTAINER       | 2.95MB    | Dec 18, 2024 at 12:00am (UTC) || alpine/3.18/cloud (1 more)               | 959a3da69418 | yes    | Alpine 3.18 amd64 (20241218_0021)         | x86_64       | CONTAINER       | 20.79MB   | Dec 18, 2024 at 12:00am (UTC) || alpine/3.19 (3 more)                     | 52a2cf969e89 | yes    | Alpine 3.19 amd64 (20241218_0022)         | x86_64       | CONTAINER       | 2.93MB    | Dec 18, 2024 at 12:00am (UTC) || alpine/3.19/cloud (1 more)               | 305be1b7f6cf | yes    | Alpine 3.19 amd64 (20241218_0021)         | x86_64       | CONTAINER       | 20.98MB   | Dec 18, 2024 at 12:00am (UTC) || alpine/3.20 (3 more)                     | 9eef9c97c1a5 | yes    | Alpine 3.20 amd64 (20241218_0021)         | x86_64       | CONTAINER       | 3.08MB    | Dec 18, 2024 at 12:00am (UTC) || alpine/3.20/cloud (1 more)               | d75bd38b9454 | yes    | Alpine 3.20 amd64 (20241218_0021)         | x86_64       | CONTAINER       | 19.67MB   | Dec 18, 2024 at 12:00am (UTC) || alpine/edge (3 more)                     | 2e72675086fe | yes    | Alpine edge amd64 (20241218_0021)         | x86_64       | CONTAINER       | 3.09MB    | Dec 18, 2024 at 12:00am (UTC) || alpine/edge/cloud (1 more)               | 6426f253d902 | yes    | Alpine edge amd64 (20241218_0021)         | x86_64       | CONTAINER       | 20.13MB   | Dec 18, 2024 at 12:00am (UTC) |root@lxconsole:~/lxd# lxc launch images:alpine/3.20/amd64 alpineCreating alpineStarting alpine                           root@lxconsole:~/lxd# lxc list+--------+---------+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+|  NAME  |  STATE  |         IPV4         |                     IPV6                      |   TYPE    | SNAPSHOTS |+--------+---------+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+| alpine | RUNNING | XX.XX.XX.XX (eth0) | XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX (eth0) | CONTAINER | 0         |+--------+---------+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+root@lxconsole:~/lxd# lxc info alpineName: alpineStatus: RUNNINGType: containerArchitecture: x86_64PID: 42834Created: 2024/12/18 16:34 ISTLast Used: 2024/12/18 16:34 ISTResources:  Processes: 5  CPU usage:    CPU usage (in seconds): 0  Memory usage:    Memory (current): 1.08MiB  Network usage:    eth0:      Type: broadcast      State: UP      Host interface: vethf8073443      MAC address: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX      MTU: 1500      Bytes received: 48.06kB      Bytes sent: 1.73kB      Packets received: 1099      Packets sent: 15      IP addresses:        inet:  XX.XX.XX.XX (global)        inet6: XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX/64 (global)        inet6: XXXX::XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX/64 (link)    lo:      Type: loopback      State: UP      MTU: 65536      Bytes received: 0B      Bytes sent: 0B      Packets received: 0      Packets sent: 0      IP addresses:        inet:  127.0.0.1/8 (local)        inet6: ::1/128 (local)As we have launched the lxc container to connect to the newly created container, execute:lxc exec {containername} {command}root@lxconsole:~# lxc exec alpine sh~ # cat /etc/os-release NAME=\"Alpine Linux\"ID=alpineVERSION_ID=3.20.3PRETTY_NAME=\"Alpine Linux v3.20\"HOME_URL=\"https://alpinelinux.org/\"BUG_REPORT_URL=\"https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/issues\"~ # launching the Debian containerHere’s an elaboration of the section:Let’s launch the Debian container in the same way we did with the Alpine container. To do this, we first need to filter out the specific image we intend to use from the list of available images. In this case, we’re opting for the “debian/12/cloud” image, which is a cloud-specific version of Debian 12. This image is optimized for cloud environments, making it ideal for container deployment.To select the image, we can run the lxc image list command, which will display a list of available images from various sources. We can use the grep command to filter through the output and narrow down the list to only the Debian 12 cloud images.Once we have the correct image identified, we can proceed to launch the container. The command we’ll use is lxc launch, followed by the image reference (images:debian/12/cloud). This will create and start the container, naming it “debian” in the process. The container will then be accessible for further management or use.&gt; root@lxconsole:~# lxc image list images: | grep debian/12| debian/12 (7 more)                       | 13829fee748c | yes    | Debian bookworm amd64 (20250102_0002)     | x86_64       | CONTAINER       | 96.04MB   | Jan 2, 2025 at 12:00am (UTC)  || debian/12 (7 more)                       | ec5f73713766 | yes    | Debian bookworm amd64 (20250102_0002)     | x86_64       | VIRTUAL-MACHINE | 351.38MB  | Jan 2, 2025 at 12:00am (UTC)  || debian/12/arm64 (3 more)                 | 7f5fbadc7060 | yes    | Debian bookworm arm64 (20241230_0004)     | aarch64      | CONTAINER       | 93.10MB   | Dec 30, 2024 at 12:00am (UTC) || debian/12/cloud (3 more)                 | 9e3c8ec9bab8 | yes    | Debian bookworm amd64 (20250102_0002)     | x86_64       | VIRTUAL-MACHINE | 394.74MB  | Jan 2, 2025 at 12:00am (UTC)  || debian/12/cloud (3 more)                 | b7ef0541b199 | yes    | Debian bookworm amd64 (20250102_0002)     | x86_64       | CONTAINER       | 122.26MB  | Jan 2, 2025 at 12:00am (UTC)  || debian/12/cloud/arm64 (1 more)           | 29ec992650ff | yes    | Debian bookworm arm64 (20241230_0004)     | aarch64      | CONTAINER       | 118.60MB  | Dec 30, 2024 at 12:00am (UTC) |&gt; root@lxconsole:~# lxc launch images:debian/12/cloud debianCreating debianStarting debian                           &gt; root@lxconsole:~# lxc list+--------+---------+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+|  NAME  |  STATE  |         IPV4         |                     IPV6                      |   TYPE    | SNAPSHOTS |+--------+---------+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+| debian | RUNNING | 10.150.239.33 (eth0) | fd42:f569:921f:766a:216:3eff:fe0f:6cc6 (eth0) | CONTAINER | 0         |+--------+---------+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+&gt; root@lxconsole:~# lxc exec debian /bin/bash&gt; root@debian:~#LXConsole allows you to manage the containers, view logs, and perform other administrative tasks from a central web interface, making it a powerful tool for container management.With LXConsole up and running, you now have a comprehensive web-based solution for managing your LXD containers.

This guide will detail the commands used and the output received during the resizing operation, providing a comprehensive overview for users looking to expand their VM’s storage capacity.Step 1: Resize Disk in ProxmoxFirst, you need to increase the disk size from the Proxmox GUI. This can be done by selecting your VM, navigating to the “Hardware” tab, and adjusting the disk size accordingly. After resizing the disk in Proxmox, you can verify the new size by using the parted command.root@pbs:~# parted                                                                                                                                                                            GNU Parted 3.5                                                                                                                                                                                Using /dev/sda                                                                                                                                                                                Welcome to GNU Parted!

This method is quite simple and efficient for setting up Jenkins in a containerized environment.Download Jenkins TurnKey ImageFirst, we need to download the Jenkins TurnKey image for Proxmox. Open your terminal and run the following command:❯ pveam download $storage debian-12-turnkey-jenkins_18.0-1_amd64.tar.gzThis command will download the image from the TurnKey Linux repository. You will see output indicating the progress of the download, and once it’s finished, you will have the image ready for use.❯ pveam download nasp debian-12-turnkey-jenkins_18.0-1_amd64.tar.gzdownloading http://mirror.turnkeylinux.org/turnkeylinux/images/proxmox/debian-12-turnkey-jenkins_18.0-1_amd64.tar.gz to /mnt/pve/nasp/template/cache/debian-12-turnkey-jenkins_18.0-1_amd64.tar.gz--2024-10-04 18:50:44--  http://mirror.turnkeylinux.org/turnkeylinux/images/proxmox/debian-12-turnkey-jenkins_18.0-1_amd64.tar.gzResolving mirror.turnkeylinux.org (mirror.turnkeylinux.org)... 137.226.34.46, 131.188.12.211, 2801:82:80ff:8000::eConnecting to mirror.turnkeylinux.org (mirror.turnkeylinux.org)|137.226.34.46|:80... connected.HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OKLength: 775492051 (740M) [application/octet-stream]Saving to: '/mnt/pve/nasp/template/cache/debian-12-turnkey-jenkins_18.0-1_amd64.tar.gz.tmp_dwnl.3535802'     0K ........ ........ ........ ........  4% 2.21M 5m20s 98304K ........ ........ ........ ........ 17% 3.15M 3m45s131072K ........ ........ ........ ........ 21% 3.85M 3m20s262144K ........ ........ ........ ........ 38% 3.02M 2m32s360448K ........ ........ ........ ........ 51% 3.53M 1m54s\\491520K ........ ........ ........ ........ 69% 3.90M 72s524288K ........ ........ ........ ........ 73% 3.72M 61s555360K ........ ........ ........ ........ 90% 3.43M 22s720896K ........ ........ ........ ........ 99% 4.07M 1s753664K ...                                100% 4.79M=3m58s2024-10-04 18:54:42 (3.11 MB/s) - '/mnt/pve/nasp/template/cache/debian-12-turnkey-jenkins_18.0-1_amd64.tar.gz.tmp_dwnl.3535802' saved [775492051/775492051]calculating checksum...OK, checksum verifieddownload of 'http://mirror.turnkeylinux.org/turnkeylinux/images/proxmox/debian-12-turnkey-jenkins_18.0-1_amd64.tar.gz' to 'template/cache/debian-12-turnkey-jenkins_18.0-1_amd64.tar.gz' finishedCreate a Container (CT)Now that we have the image, we can create a container using it. Here’s how you can do it:  Open Proxmox Web Interface: Go to your Proxmox web interface.  Create CT: Click on “Create CT” and follow the prompts to set up your container.  Select Template: When prompted, select the downloaded Jenkins TurnKey image as your template.Starting the Jenkins VMOnce the container is created, boot it up. When you try to access the Jenkins UI for the first time, you will see a message like this:  Welcome to TurnKey! You need to initialize this system first before you can use it. To do that you’ll need to log into the root account via SSH. The turnkey-init initialization program should start automatically After initialization try reloading this page. This message should disappear and you’ll be able to access all services on this system normally.Login into the container by using the ssh service and reset the credentialsPerform Security UpdatesFor security reasons, it is recommended to perform updates after installation. Run the following command in your terminal:Once the security patches are installed and configured reboot the containerAccess Jenkins Web UIAfter rebooting, access the Jenkins web UI again by navigating to “https://&lt;your-container-ip&gt;”. You should see the Jenkins control panel.Manage Jenkins PluginsOnce logged in, go to Manage Jenkins &gt; Manage Plugins &gt; Updates and install all latest updates for plugins.Install Dark Theme (Optional)If you prefer a dark theme, you can install it from the plugin manager as well.Final StepsAfter updating all plugins and installing any desired themes, restart your Jenkins container one last time.And that’s it! You have successfully installed Jenkins on Proxmox using a TurnKey image. Enjoy automating your builds and deployments with Jenkins!For more robust information on using Jenkins, you can refer to the official Jenkins documentation available at Jenkins Documentation"

    "content": "This guide explains how to set up your Proxmox node to respond to Wake-on-LAN (WoL) messages, allowing you to start your server remotely using a “magic packet.”installing toolsFirst, you’ll need to install the required tool ethtool on your Proxmox node. Open a terminal or go to your node’s shell and run:❯ sudo apt install ethtoolGet your interface name❯ ip a sThe output will list all your network interfaces. In this case, we’re looking for an interface that’s currently in use. For example:eno1: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc mq master vmbr0 state UP group default qlen 1000    link/ether XXXXXXXXXXX brd XXXXXXXXXXX    altname enp1s0f0Here, eno1 is the name of the network interface.Check If Wake-on-LAN is EnabledBefore enabling Wake-on-LAN, it’s a good idea to check if it is already active on your interface. Run:❯ ethtool eno1 | grep Wake-onThe output will look like this:        Supports Wake-on: pumbg        Wake-on: dIn this example, Wake-on-LAN is disabled (d stands for “disabled”). We will enable it.Enable wake-on-lanTo enable the wake on lan we use the ethool and specify the insterface on which we want to enable it❯ ethtool -s eno1 wol gUpdating the Network Interfaces FileTo make sure that Wake-on-LAN stays enabled after a reboot, we need to add this configuration to the network interfaces file. Open the file using:❯ nano /etc/network/interfacesLook for your interface (in our case eno1) and add the following line below the iface configuration:post-up /usr/sbin/ethtool -s enp6s0 wol gThe section for eno1 should now look something like this:auto eno1  iface eno1 inet manual  post-up /usr/sbin/ethtool -s eno1 wol gThis ensures that WoL will remain enabled after reboots.Reload Proxmox Network SettingsTo apply the changes, reload the network configuration from the Proxmox GUI. Go to your Proxmox node, then navigate to System &gt; Network. Find your WoL-enabled interface (eno1), click “Edit,” and add the “Autostart” flag. Save the changes.Testing Wake-on-LANNow that the configuration is set, you can test it. Turn off your Proxmox node and use a WoL tool to send a magic packet to the node’s network interface. I’m using the built-in WoL feature in ipfire to send the magic packet.If your Proxmox node powers up, the Wake-on-LAN setup is complete and working correctly."

    "content": "Installing IPFire Firewall on ProxmoxIPFire is a powerful open-source firewall that can be installed on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems. If you have an old PC lying around, you can repurpose it as a firewall. IPFire is known for its flexibility, and it’s great for securing networks in both home and small business environments.  Open-source: It’s free and constantly updated by the community.  Security: Offers strong protection for your network with features like intrusion detection, VPN, and more.  Customizable: It can be tailored to your specific network needs.Download the ipfire ISOTo get started, you’ll need to download the IPFire ISO. Run the following command to download the ISO directly to your Proxmox storage:wget -O /mnt/pve/$storage/template/iso/ipfire-2.29-core188-x86_64.iso https://downloads.ipfire.org/releases/ipfire-2.x/2.29-core188/ipfire-2.29-core188-x86_64.isocreating the vmTo create a virtual machine (VM) for IPFire in Proxmox, follow these steps:  Click on Create VM.  Go to the General tab and set the preferred VM ID and name.  In the OS section, choose the downloaded IPFire ISO from $storage.  Set up the disk as per your requirements in the Disk section.  Configure CPU and Memory depending on your system needs.Once the VM is created, add two network interfaces: one for WAN and one for LAN.System Requirements            Component      Minimum Requirements      Recommended Requirements                  Processor (CPU)      1 GHz single-core      Multi-core (2+ cores) with AES-NI support              Memory (RAM)      1 GB      2-4 GB or more, especially for IDS/IPS, VPN              Storage      4 GB (HDD/SSD)      20 GB SSD for better performance and longevity              Network Interface      At least 2 NICs (10/100 Mbps)      2 NICs (Gigabit) Intel or Broadcom NICs for reliability        If you prefer to install IPFire on bare metal, you can create bootable media. Visit the official IPFire Download page and grab the ISO image according to your system architecture.Installing the distributionOnce the vm is created and the two networking nics are attached start the vm.Next, choose the Language as respective to your region.At this step, you can see that, if you do not wish to continue the setup you can Cancel the setup and reboot the machine.Accept the license by pressing the Space bar to choose, and press OK to continue.The system will format your disk to install the IPFire system. Please note that all data on the disk will be erased.Next, choose the file system as EXT4 and continue to the future steps.Once, you select the filesystem type, the installation begins and disk will be formatted and system files will be installed.Once installation completes, press OK to reboot to finalize the installation and continue with the further installation to configure ISDN, network cards, and system passwords.After the system reboot, it will prompt you IPFire boot menu option, select the default option by pressing the enter key.choose the keyboard layout from the drop-down list as shown below. and choose the time zone you preffered                               Choose a hostname for our IPFirewall machine. By default, it will be ipfire. I’m not going to make any changes in these steps. and Give a valid domain name, if you have a local DNS server or we can define it later. Here, I am using “secsys.pro” as my local DNS server domain name.                               Enter a password for the root and admin user, This will be used for command-line access and provide a password for the admin user for the IPFire GUI web interface. The password must be different from the command line access credentials for security reasons.                               IPFire Network Configuration SettingsDuring IPFire installation, the network is configured into various segments. This segmented security scheme indicates that there is a suitable place for each system in the network and it can be enabled separately as per our requirements.Each segment acts as a group of machines that share a common security level, which is described in four different colors of zones i.e. Green, Red, Blue, and Orange.  Green  – This represents that we are in a safe area. Clients in the Green area will be without any restrictions and connected internally/locally.  Red  – This indicates that we are in danger or disconnected from the outside world; nothing will be allowed through the firewall unless specifically configured by the admins.  Blue  – This represents the ‘wireless‘ network, which is used for the local area network.  Orange  – This refers to the ‘DMZ‘ (demilitarized zone). Any servers that are accessible publicly are separated from the rest of the network to minimize security breaches.                               Once the Network configuration type is selected then network cards to each adaptor RED and Green zones                               Assign IP Addresses for Network InterfacesHere we have only 2 interfaces and we need to assign IP addresses in different sub-nets one for the RED zone and another for Green zoneIf we use 192.168.0.100 for the RED interface, we must use different IP and network for other interface. For the RED interface we going to use static IP address for both RED and green zones                               If you want to enable the DHCP for the GREEN interface for the local/internal interfaces you can can configure the DHCP pool range as i am using the tp-link (TL-S3210) for DHCP service will skip the DHCP.We have almost completed our setup, Choose OK to complete the IPFire setup.Accessing Web interfaceTo access the web interface connect to the green network and enter https://$I:444/ with the username as “admin” and the password that we’ve set at above.conclusionIPFire is a versatile firewall solution suitable for various environments. Whether you are setting it up for home or small business use, its security features, flexibility, and community-driven updates make it a great choice for protecting your network. for more settings and customization please reffer the official IPfire documentation"

    "content": "IntroductionAfter installing Proxmox VE (Virtual Environment), there are several essential post-installation steps to ensure that your system is configured correctly and optimized for performance. This guide walks you through managing Proxmox VE repositories, updating the system, handling processor microcode updates, and setting up automatic LXC updates.1. Managing Proxmox VE RepositoriesProxmox VE repositories need to be configured correctly to ensure you receive updates and access the necessary packages. The following script helps manage these repositories by:  Disabling the Enterprise Repo.  Adding or correcting Proxmox VE sources.  Enabling the No-Subscription Repo.  Adding the Test Repo.  Disabling the subscription nag.Running the Repository Management ScriptTo streamline the configuration process, run the following command in the Proxmox VE Shell:bash -c \"$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/tteck/Proxmox/raw/main/misc/post-pve-install.sh)\"Note: It is recommended to answer “yes” (y) to all options presented during the process. This will ensure that all necessary configurations and updates are applied correctly.Script OutputThe script performs several tasks, including:  Correcting Proxmox VE sources.  Disabling the ‘pve-enterprise’ repository and enabling the ‘pve-no-subscription’ repository.  Correcting Ceph package repositories and adding the ‘pvetest’ repository.  Disabling the subscription nag (you might need to delete your browser cache).

    "content": "Installing MediCatIn this guide, we’ll walk through the steps to install MediCat on a USB drive. MediCat is a powerful tool for diagnostics, troubleshooting, and recovery.PrerequisitesBefore we begin, make sure you have the following:  A USB drive with at least 32GB of space (Recomended 64GB)  A USB drive with Ventoy already installed (Recomended)  A downloaded archive of MediCat (~22GB)  Windows Defender and other antivirus tools temporarily disabled (since they may interfere with the installation process)  Please select the USB drive carefully during the installation process, as the disk will be completely wiped.Step 1: Preparing the USB DriveTo start, you’ll need to install Ventoy on your USB drive. Ventoy is a tool that allows you to create a bootable USB drive that can host multiple ISO files without reformatting the drive.Begin by downloading the latest version of Ventoy from the official website. Once downloaded, extract the Ventoy archive to a folder on your computer.In the extracted folder, locate and run the Ventoy2Disk.exe (or the corresponding executable for your operating system).Next, select the USB drive you want to use with Ventoy. Be cautious when choosing the drive, as this process will format it. After confirming that you’ve selected the correct drive, click the “Install” button. The tool will prompt you to confirm the installation, warning that all data on the USB drive will be erased. Confirm and proceed.Once the installation is complete, you will see a success message. Your USB drive is now ready with Ventoy installed.Since we’ve manually installed Ventoy, there’s no need to format the USB drive again. Additionally, it’s important to temporarily disable Windows Defender and any other antivirus tools because they may interfere with the installation process.After disabling Windows Defender, you can proceed by launching the MediCat installer and accepting the license agreement.                               Step 2: Installing MediCatThe installer will prompt you to select the disk where MediCat will be installed. Double-check that you have selected the correct drive to avoid any data loss. During the installation of MediCat, you have the option to disable drive formatting. This step is crucial if you have already installed Ventoy, as formatting the disk would remove Ventoy from the USB drive. Make sure to disable formatting before proceeding.                               Step 3: Handling the MediCat ArchiveIf you already have the MediCat archive downloaded (approximately 22GB), select “No” when asked to download it during the installation process. Then, manually select the downloaded file. This saves time, as downloading it again would take a while.If you haven’t downloaded the archive yet, you can opt to download it during this step, though it will extend the installation time.Step 4: Finalizing the InstallationOnce you’ve selected the MediCat archive file (or downloaded it), the installer will begin the installation process. If you’ve chosen the “Download Now” option, the file will be downloaded first, and then the installation will proceed.  As medicat needs to install/configure the 22GB archive it’s took me about 2 hour 40 minutes to complete the installation/checks.Congratulations! You’ve successfully installed MediCat on your USB drive."

    "content": "Grafana is a powerful open-source analytics and monitoring tool that allows you to visualize data in a highly customizable way. This guide will walk you through the steps to install Grafana from the APT repository on a Debian system.PrerequisitesBefore you start, make sure your system is up-to-date. Run the following commands to update your package list and upgrade all installed packagessudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get upgrade -yAdditionally, ensure that you have sudo privileges to execute administrative commands.Step 1: Install Prerequisite PackagesGrafana requires some prerequisite packages. Install them by running the following command:sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https software-properties-common wget  apt-transport-https: Allows APT to communicate over HTTPS, which is required for secure access to external repositories.  software-properties-common: Provides a utility for managing software repositories.  wget: A utility to download files from the web.Step 2: Import the Grafana GPG KeyTo ensure the integrity of the packages you are about to install, you need to import the Grafana GPG key. This key is used to verify the authenticity of the packages. Run the following commands:sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings/wget -q -O - https://apt.grafana.com/gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/grafana.gpg &gt; /dev/null  mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings/: Creates a directory to store GPG keys.  wget -q -O - https://apt.grafana.com/gpg.key: Downloads the Grafana GPG key.  gpg –dearmor: Converts the GPG key to a format that APT can use.  sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/grafana.gpg &gt; /dev/null: Saves the key to the appropriate location.Step 3: Add the Grafana APT RepositoryNext, you need to add the Grafana APT repository to your system’s list of package sources. This will allow you to install Grafana directly from the APT repository. You have two options:Stable ReleasesFor stable releases of Grafana, run the following command:echo \"deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/grafana.gpg] https://apt.grafana.com stable main\" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.listBeta ReleasesIf you want to install beta releases of Grafana, use this command instead:echo \"deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/grafana.gpg] https://apt.grafana.com beta main\" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.listThis will add the chosen repository to your system’s package sources.Step 4: Update the Package ListAfter adding the repository, you need to update the list of available packages:sudo apt-get updateThis will fetch the latest package information from the newly added Grafana repository.Step 5: Install Grafana OSFinally, to install the latest open-source release of Grafana, run the following command:sudo apt-get install grafanaThis will download and install Grafana and its dependencies.Step 6: Start and Enable GrafanaAfter the installation is complete, you can start Grafana and enable it to start at boot with the following commands:sudo systemctl start grafana-serversudo systemctl enable grafana-server  start grafana-server: Starts the Grafana service immediately.  enable grafana-server: Configures Grafana to start automatically on system boot.Step 7: Access GrafanaGrafana runs on port 3000 by default. You can access the Grafana web interface by opening your web browser and navigating to:http://your-server-ip:3000  Change the /etc/grafana/grafana.ini file according to your needs and restart the grafana serviceReplace your-server-ip with your server’s actual IP address.Default Login CredentialsThe default username and password for Grafana are:  Username: admin  Password: adminUpon the first login, you will be prompted to change the password.

Click on Add backup to start the configuration process.First, give your backup a name that helps you identify it easily, such as “Docker Directory Backup.” If you want to encrypt your backup, select the encryption option and securely store the passphrase.Configure Backup DestinationFor the storage type, select SFTP since you are backing up to another server. Enter the IP address or hostname of the remote server and specify the directory where you want the backups to be stored (e.g., /home/$user/backup). Provide the SFTP username and password or SSH key for the remote server. This setup ensures that your backups are securely transferred to and stored on the remote server.  Make sure you use the full path on the server (e.g., /home/$user/backup).Next, navigate through the file browser in Duplicati to select the data you wish to back up. In this example, select the Docker directory. Ensure you use the full path to the directory (e.g., /home/$user/docker). You can include or exclude specific files and folders based on your needs.Schedule the BackupConfigure the backup schedule to automate the process according to your needs. You might schedule daily or weekly backups, depending on how often your data changes. Additionally, set retention policies to keep only a certain number of backups or delete backups older than a specified time.Enable NotificationsWhile Duplicati doesn’t have built-in support for sending notifications to Discord, you can configure the duplicati-notifications container to send notifications upon backup completion. In Duplicati settings, you can configure email notifications or use scripts to trigger custom notifications. Set up duplicati-notifications to integrate with your Discord server, ensuring that you receive a detailed notification about the backup status in your Discord channel.                               Run the BackupOnce everything is configured, run the backup to ensure it’s working as expected. Monitor the progress in the Duplicati dashboard and view logs for any issues. After completion, a notification will be sent to your Discord server                               Verify and RestorePeriodically, it’s a good practice to verify that your backups are functioning correctly and that you can restore data when needed. Duplicati provides a straightforward restore process, which can be initiated from the dashboard.For more advanced configuration options, refer to the Duplicati manual."

    "content": "In the world of modern application development, containers have become the go-to solution for deploying, scaling, and managing software. However, managing these containers can be complex, especially as environments grow in size and complexity. This is where Portainer comes in—a powerful and user-friendly container management platform designed to streamline containerized application management across various environments, including cloud, datacenters, and Industrial IoT.What is Portainer? Portainer is a container management tool that offers a web-based interface for managing Docker environments and Kubernetes clusters. Its simplicity makes it accessible to both beginners and experienced users, providing all the features necessary to deploy, troubleshoot, and secure applications effortlessly.Core Features of PortainerPortainer’s primary goal is to simplify the management of containerized environments. It achieves this through a range of features tailored to different use cases.Container Management Deploying containers with Portainer is a breeze, whether you use pre-configured templates or custom configurations. You can manage Docker images, networks, volumes, and services, all from a central dashboard. For multi-container applications, Portainer allows easy management using Docker Compose or Kubernetes manifests, and it provides real-time visibility into the performance of your containers.Prerequisites  Docker Engine and Docker Compose packages are installed and running  A non-root user with Docker privilegesSetting up the portainer ServerCreate the directory structureTo keep the docker directory clean i have created a portainer directory to store the configuration file. My file structure is as follows:mkdir ~/docker/portainer/datatouch ~/docker/portainer/docker-compose.yml📂portainer|--📂 data|   |--📂 backups|   |   |--📂 common|   |   |   |-- portainer.db.2.19.1.20231204141757|   |   |   `-- portainer.db.2.19.4.20240423030116|   |   `-- portainer.db.bak|   |--📂 bin|   |--📂 certs|   |   |-- cert.pem|   |   `-- key.pem|   |--📂 chisel|   |   `-- private-key.pem|   |--📂 compose|   |--📂 docker_config|   |   `-- config.json|   |-- portainer.db|   |-- portainer.key|   |-- portainer.pub|   `--📂 tls`--📑 docker-compose.ymlDocker ConfigurationWith the directory structure in place, let’s edit the docker-compose.yml file using your favorite text editor. Here’s an example configuration:services:  portainer:    image: portainer/portainer-ce:latest    container_name: portainer    restart: unless-stopped    security_opt:      - no-new-privileges:true    networks:      - proxy    volumes:      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro      - ./data:/data    ports:      - 9443:9443      - 9000:9000networks:  proxy:    external: trueVerify and launch the containerto verify the docker compose files has no issues use docker compose config Once you have the docker-compose.yml file you can run docker-compose up -d which will create the volume, download the image and start the container in the backgroundTo verify the status of all running containers, run the docker-compose command:docker-compose ps (OR) docker ps -aIf something goes wrong, you can check the logs for each container using the docker logs command and specify the service name. For example, to check the log of the Nginx Proxy Manager container, run the following command:docker logs $container (OR) docker compose logs -fAccessing the Portainer dashboardIf all is well, you can locally view your portainer Server by navigating to http://localhost:9443. You should see something that looks like the following. The first time you access Portainer, the system asks to create a password for the admin user. Type the password twice and select the Create user button. once you login you can able to access the portainerFor a more detailed guide, you can check the official documentation at Portainer Documentation.Launching the nginx containerAfter setting up Portainer, you can verify that everything is working as expected by deploying a simple Nginx container.To get started, access the Portainer dashboard by navigating to http://localhost:9443 in your web browser. Log in using the admin credentials you set up earlier.In the dashboard, go to the Containers section and click Add Container. Name the container nginx and set the image to nginx:latest, which will pull the latest Nginx image from Docker Hub. For port configuration, map port 80 in the container to port 8080 on your host by entering 8080:80.After configuring the settings, deploy the container. Once deployed, open a new browser tab and visit http://localhost:8080 or http://serverIp:8080. If the deployment is successful, the default Nginx welcome page will appear.This simple test confirms that Portainer is correctly managing your Docker containers. If issues arise, check the container logs within the Portainer interface by selecting the container and navigating to the Logs tab.After following the steps in this tutorial, you should now have a fully functional Portainer setup to manage Docker containers on your Linux system. The tutorial guided you through installing the Portainer Server, configuring it, and testing the setup by deploying an Nginx container.With Portainer, managing your Docker environments becomes more straightforward, allowing you to add and manage containers, monitor performance, and troubleshoot issues with ease. Whether you’re working with a single environment or managing multiple Docker instances, Portainer provides a unified platform to simplify your container management tasks."

SIGNUPS_VERIFY_RESEND_TIME: If SIGNUPS_VERIFY is set to true, this value specifies how many seconds a user must wait before another verification email can be sent.  SIGNUPS_VERIFY_RESEND_LIMIT: If SIGNUPS_VERIFY is set to true, this value specifies the maximum number of times an email verification may be re-sent.  SIGNUPS_DOMAINS_WHITELIST: This setting is a comma separated list of domains that can register for Vaultwarden accounts, even if SIGNUPS_ALLOWED is set to false. This is useful for when your Vaultwarden accounts are to be used specifically by email addresses whose domains you control.SMTP Settings  SMTP_HOST: This is your SMTP mailserver.  SMTP_FROM: This is the email address messages will be sent from.  SMTP_FROM_NAME: The name you wish to appear as the email account name on sent messages  SMTP_SECURITY: The security method used by your SMTP server. Possible values: “starttls” / “force_tls” / “off”.  SMTP_PORT: This is the SMTP port used by your mail server. Possible values: 587 / 465.  SMTP_USERNAME: This is the login for your SMTP mail server.  SMTP_PASSWORD: This is the password for your SMTP credentials.  SMTP_AUTH_MECHANISM: This is the SMTP authentication mechanism of your mail server. Possible values: “Plain” / “Login” / “Xoauth2”.I’m using Vaultwarden which is an opensource project. It is not owned by Bitwarden. They’re an unofficial bitwarden compatible server written in Rust.Save your docker-compose.yml file and exit back to your bitwarden directory.Verify and launch the containerto verify the docker compose files has no issues use docker compose config Once you have the docker-compose.yml file you can run docker-compose up -d which will create the volume, download the image and start the container in the backgroundTo verify the status of all running containers, run the docker-compose command:docker-compose ps (OR) docker ps -aIf something goes wrong, you can check the logs for each container using the docker logs command and specify the service name. For example, to check the log of the Nginx Proxy Manager container, run the following command:docker logs $container (OR) docker compose logs -fAccessing the bitwarden dashboardIf all is well, you can locally view your Bitwarden Server by navigating to http://localhost:PORT. Or from another machine by using your ip address instead of localhostYou should see something that looks like the following.Finally, you’ll just need to register for an account on your new hosted instance.Click the Create Account buttonThen fill out your details. If you have an existing Bitwarden account, you’ll still have to create a new account on this instance. You can then Export and Import your credentials.                               Browsers like chrome, firefox … also has the inbuilt vaults to store the credentials you can also export the credentials in a csv/json format and exportYou can use the Nginx proxy manager to create the reverse proxy and configure the lets-encrypt SSL certificate to remove the SSL warningsyou can use the bitwarden clients applications/browser extensions to access the stored credentials Application firefox extension chrome extension  For More details please check the github issues discussions"

    "content": "IntroductionToday we will learn about the server-side request forgery attack. While enumerating, we discovered the FTP credentials through which we gain access to the server via ssh and the root using the Python library. With that stated, let’s get started.As is customary, we will begin by scanning the server for open ports using the nmap.We only have two open ports: SSH (OpenSSH) and Apache (for the webpage). Let’s examine the web server.We have a standard website with an image upload option. We can upload images in two ways: one from a local computer and the other from a URL.To receive the request from the server to our local system, I had setup the Python server from scratch. So we can be sure the server is sending us the request.EnumerationWhile the web server is operating, let’s use the sec list wordlist to run the gobuster for directory listing.However, we just have the uploads directory, which redirects /uploads to /upload, and I didn’t find much in the directory, so I began the DNS enumeration using the wordlist present in seclist itself.I discovered another subdomain admin, however it was only accessible via localhost.However, we can send the request from the server to our localhost and then redirect the web server to the admin page.Let me describe the situation. We use the upload function to send the request to our localhost, from which we redirect the web server to the restricted admin panel. Let us try…We received the request from the remote server, which was fulfilled by my scratch python web server, and we received success and an address to view our files.Let’s open this URL in a browser, however I didn’t get a response from the server when I tried to curl the same address, but I can see the content of the admin section.Ftp accessI located the FTP credentials.I am unable to access the FTP port since it has been filtered.Considering that we have URL redirection, let us redirect the web server to the FTP server to review the content.As we can access the files, let us copy the user’s private ssh keys in order to login via SSH, as the ssh port was open.We have the ssh user’s private key, which we store to a file and use to login to the server through ssh.Escalating PrivilegesLet’s look at the user’s permissions. We can execute /opt/remote-manage.py. Because this script expected numbers as input, let’s cause an error by pressing the random key, which takes us to the Python debugger ( PDB ). We can acquire root access via the PDB."

Tools like Nmap are used to scan for open ports and services running on those ports. Gobuster is utilized to search for web directories, while Nikto helps in identifying common vulnerabilities in web servers. This step helps the attacker understand the target’s attack surface and plan their approach accordingly.As we always do let’s start scanning the box for the open ports with Nmap gobuster for web directories and Nikto for common vulnerabilityBy looking at the results we there are three ports open FTP SSH and APACHE web server.

    "content": "what is shell shock vulnerabilityShellshock is a security bug causing Bash to execute commands from environment variables unintentionally. In other words if exploited the vulnerability allows the attacker to remotely issue commands on the server, also known as remote code execution. Even though Bash is not an internet-facing service, many internet and network services such as web servers use environment variables to communicate with the server’s operating system.Since the environment variables are not sanitized properly by Bash before being executed, the attacker can send commands to the server through HTTP requests and get them executed by the web server operating system.ScanningLet’s scan with the nmap to find the open services on the boxnmap -sC default scripts -sV enumerate version -oN output out format ipWe have two services open one is being SSH and the other is HTTP.

The color- respectivly sample-frequencies are not changed thus making the embedding resistant against first-order statistical tests.Steganography literally means covered writing. Its goal is to hide the fact that communication is taking place. This is often achieved by using a (rather large) cover file and embedding the (rather short) secret message into this file. The result is a innocuous looking file (the stego file) that contains the secret message.wpscanWPScan is an open source WordPress security scanner. You can use it to scan your WordPress website for known vulnerabilities within the WordPress core, as well as popular WordPress plugins and themes.Since it is a WordPress black box scanner, it mimics a real attacker. This means it does not rely on any sort of access to your WordPress dashboard or source code to conduct the tests. In other words, if WPScan can find a vulnerability in your WordPress website, so can an attacker.WPScan uses the vulnerability database called wpvulndb.com to check the target for known vulnerabilities. The team which develops WPScan maintains this database. It has an ever-growing list of WordPress core, plugins and themes vulnerabilities.With the help of the wpscan we can got the users names and we dont have a valid password to login let’s bruteforce to find the valid passwordBrute ForceWe have a valid username and password login with that creds into the wordpressWordPress Crop-image Shell UploadAs the above WordPress version is 5.0 we have WordPress Crop-image Shell Upload vulnerability present in this version. This exploits a path traversal and a local file inclusion vulnerability on WordPress versions 5.0.0 and &lt;= 4.9.8.The crop-image function allows a user, with at least author privileges, to resize an image and perform a path traversal by changing the _wp_attached_file reference during the upload.The second part of the exploit will include this image in the current theme by changing the _wp_page_template attribute when creating a post. This exploit module only works for Unix-based systems currently.metasploitLet’s fire up the metasploit framework and run the crop image exploit by setting the WordPress login credentials. if you don’t have metasploit framework you can install it by using this single command in your terminalcurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-omnibus/master/config/templates/metasploit-framework-wrappers/msfupdate.erb &gt; msfinstall &amp;&amp; chmod 755 msfinstall &amp;&amp; ./msfinstallone’s you set all the requirements run it and we have a meterpreter shell opened as a low level userEnumerationwith the help of find command lets check the enumerate of all binaries having SUID permission. find / -perm -u=s -type f 2&gt;/dev/nullThe /usr/sbin/checker file seems to be interesting and all the  other files are quite common. let’s trace the checker with ltrace and we export admin = 1 and we have a nice root shell hearThat’s all for to day hope you like the box.

As the nmap scan results ANONYMOUS login’s are allowed let’s check the ftpAs we have .creds and the test.txt files get this files and exit from ftp. As we have a binary code in .creds let’s decode it with the cyberchefAfter decoding it you will find a SSH user name and password login with that user &amp; passwordWe have a successful login and we are into the box with low level user and we have nothing to do from hear except we have a cmd_service.pyc file. Let’s download the file with the Secure copy protocol (scp) followed by the user name IP and location of file to copyscp user@ip:location/of/file.pyc.pyc files are created by the Python interpreter when a .py file is imported. They contain the “compiled bytecode” of the imported module/program so that the “translation” from source code to bytecode (which only needs to be done once) can be skipped on subsequent imports if the .pyc is newer than the corresponding .py file, thus speeding startup a little. But it’s still interpreted.Once the *.pyc file is generated, there is no need of *.py file, unless you edit it. But we can’t able to read the bytecode we have convert the bytecode into the .py script. For this we need a tool called uncompile6 install it and run it you will get the python codeuncompyle6 cmd_service.pyc &gt; code.pyWe can also find that the code is starting the server on local at port 7321 and credentials to login. Let’s connect it with the NETCAT. Copy the private key of the userSave it to a file and change the permission of the id_rsa and SSH with that with the private keyif we check the permissions of the user we may only run the peak_hil_farm as a ROOT user with out the passwordlet’s create a pickle exploit to give us the setuid binarySet User ID is a type of permission that allows users to execute a file with the permissions of a specified user. Those files which have suid permissions run with higher privileges.  Assume we are accessing the target system as a non-root user and we found suid bit enabled binaries, then those file/program/command can run with root privileges.Hope you like the box, HAVE A GREAT DAY"

    "content": "we are going to solve an online challenge called the overpass. As we find the two open ports one is being ssh on port 22 and the other HTTP on port 80. we find the private ssh key and we will crack the password with john tool through which we will ssh into the box and we will do some basic enumeration in the box to get the root user with all being said lets get startedFirst we will start with the nmap to find the open portsnmap -sC -sV -oN nmap/initial_scan $IPLet’s take a look at the port 80. we have Overpass page saying that a secure password manager with support for windows, Linux, macos and moreLet’s fire up the gobuster to find the directories and the pages present in it and save the output yo gobuster.loggobuster dir -u http://10.10.44.66/ -w /usr/share/wordlist/dirbuster/directorylist-2.3-medium.txt -o gobuster.log Lets open the /admin page we find a simple login page nothing interesting there. let’s open the page source we will find the login.js java script there open the java script file as we send the request sessiontoken = something.  we will get to /adminLet send the request through the curl by adding the cookie sessiontoken=anythingcurl \"http://10.10.44.66/admin/\" --cookie \"SessionToken=anything\"Here we got an private ssh key. copy the private ssh key to a file and change the permission of the private key and lets try to ssh it with the keyAs the private key is asking for password lets try to crack it with the john too. For this john has a ssh2john,py script first we have to execute a script on private key and save it to a filessh2john.py id_rsa &gt; forjohn.txtNow run the john tool we will get the password as james13As we have the private ssh key and the password lets ssh into itwe are now in as a low level user let’s do some enumeration to get the high level user. Let’s start the HTTP server and upload the linpeas.sh and run itpython3 -m http.server &amp;&amp; chmod +x linpeas.sh &amp;&amp; ./linpeas.shA little bit of enumeration our user can run curl as root only on overpass.thm domainLet’s modify the domain address to our ip address so that we can get the root usermake the request is going through the downloads/src/buildscript.sh let’s make the directories for it and make the bildscript.sh to run in bash and start the http servermkdir -p downloads/src &amp;&amp; cd $_ &amp;&amp; vi buildscript.sh &amp;&amp;sudo python3 -m http.server                        These script will  gives us the accessible root privileges through bash binary setuidThat’s all for to day hope you like the box see you i next tutorial until then good bye have  a great day"
