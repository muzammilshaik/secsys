This is a continuation from Part 2 of the Bandit Wargame series. If you haven’t checked out [Part 1 blog]({% post_url 2025-01-24-bandit-1 %}){:target="_blank"}, I highly recommend giving it a read before proceeding, as it covers foundational skills essential for tackling these levels.

Now, let’s pick up where we left off and dive deeper into the challenges, starting from Bandit Level 11. These levels will introduce more advanced concepts, helping you sharpen your Linux skills further. Let’s get started!



## Bandit Level 11 → Level 12
**Level Goal**

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions

```
bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt
Gur cnffjbeq vf 7k16JArUVv5LxVuJfsSVdbbtaHGlw9D4
bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
The password is 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4
bandit11@bandit:~$
```

![bandit](/assets/ctf/community/overthewire/Bandit/bandit1.png){: width="800" height="500" }

**Explanaiton**

the `tr` (translate) command in Linux or Unix-like systems to perform a character-by-character transformation of text. Specifically, this command implements the `ROT13` cipher for encoding or decoding text.

`ROT13` (short for "rotate by 13 places") is a simple letter substitution cipher used primarily for obscuring text. It replaces each letter of the alphabet with the letter 13 positions ahead of it. Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, applying ROT13 twice (rotating 13 positions forward and then 13 positions back) restores the original text.

For example:
- "A" becomes "N"
- "B" becomes "O"
- "C" becomes "P"
- "Z" becomes "M"

The beauty of ROT13 is its simplicity. It is often used in online forums or email to obscure spoilers, puzzle answers, or sensitive information, as it does not provide real encryption but just hides the content in plain view.

## Bandit Level 12 → Level 13
**Level Goal**

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

```
bandit12@bandit:~$ mktemp -d
/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek
bandit12@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ cp ~/data.txt .

bandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ file data8
data8: ASCII text
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/tmp.1gzcyg61Ek$ cat data8
The password is FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn
```

**Explanation**

- Create a temp directory using `mktemp -d`, copy `data.txt` into it and reverse the hex dump with `xxd -r` to get the `binary` file.
- Identify the file type with `file` and decompress or extract it repeatedly based on its format:
  - For **gzip**: Rename with `.gz` and decompress using `gzip -d`.
  - For **bzip2**: Rename with `.bz2` and decompress using `bzip2 -d`.
  - For **tar** archives: Extract using `tar -xf`.
- Repeat the process (analyzing and decompressing/extracting) until reaching the final file.
- Read the final ASCII text file using cat, which revealed the password

## Bandit Level 13 → Level 14
**Level Goal**

The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

```
bandit13@bandit:~$ ls
sshkey.private
bandit13@bandit:~$ cat sshkey.private

## Bandit Level 14 → Level 15
**Level Goal**

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.

```
bandit14@bandit:~$ echo "test" | nc localhost 30000
Wrong! Please enter the correct current password.
bandit14@bandit:~$ mkdir /tmp/tmp.testing/

❯ scp -i key -P 2220 linpeas.sh bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:/tmp/tmp.testing/
linpeassh                                                100%  820KB 516.7KB/s   00:01

MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS
bandit14@bandit:/tmp/tmp.testing$ echo "$(cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14)" | nc localhost 30000
Correct!
8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo

bandit14@bandit:/tmp/tmp.testing$ 
```

**Explanation**

- First tried to send the $RANDOM data to the port 30000 using the nc
- created the temp upload the [linpeas.sh](https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh){:target="_blank"} and uploaded the script using the scp as we have the private key
- `linpeas.sh` found the password for the bandit14 user stored in the file `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14`
- submitted it through nc to port 30000. This allowed you to successfully get the password for the next level

## Bandit Level 15 → Level 16
**Level Goal**

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL/TLS encryption.

Helpful note: Getting “DONE”, “RENEGOTIATING” or “KEYUPDATE”? Read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage.

```
bandit15@bandit:/tmp/t15$ echo "$(cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit15)"| ncat --ssl localhost 30001
Correct!
kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx

bandit15@bandit:/tmp/t15$
```

## Bandit Level 16 → Level 17
**Level Goal**

The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

Helpful note: Getting “DONE”, “RENEGOTIATING” or “KEYUPDATE”? Read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage.

```

```

**Explanation**

- First lets scan the open ports on the meachine using the nmap with `-p` opein with ports 31000 to 32000 using the script `ssl-enum-ciphers`
- As we can see only two ports are lisening with SSL/TLS conneciton 
- Echo the password with `ncat --ssl localhost 31790` to establish an encrypted (SSL/TLS) connection to a service running on port 31790 

## Bandit Level 17 → Level 18
**Level Goal**

There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new

NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‘Byebye!’ when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19

```
bandit17@bandit:~$ diff -wy --suppress-common-lines passwords.new passwords.old

bandit17@bandit:~$
```

## Bandit Level 18 → Level 19
**Level Goal**

The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.

```

- `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no` disables the SSH host key checking, meaning it won't prompt you about the authenticity of the host (like the warning about adding the host to known_hosts).
- `bash --norc` It will runs the bash shell on the remote machine but skips reading the `.bashrc` file using the `--norc` option. This avoids any configurations (like auto-logout) that might be present in the .bashrc file.

## Bandit Level 19 → Level 20
**Level Goal**

To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.

```
bandit19@bandit:~$ ls
bandit20-do

bandit19@bandit:~$ file bandit20-do
bandit20-do: setuid ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=368cd8ac4633fabdf3f4fb1c47a250634d6a8347, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped

bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do id

bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO
bandit19@bandit:~$
```

**Explanation**
- The files in the directory are listed, revealing an executable file named `bandit20-do`.
- The `file` command identifies it as a setuid ELF executable, meaning it runs with the permissions of its owner.
- Executing `./bandit20-do` without any arguments provides information that it allows running commands as another user.
- The command `./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20` is used to read the password for the next level, `bandit20`, successfully retrieving the required password.
