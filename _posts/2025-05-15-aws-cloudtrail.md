          Imports a certificate into Amazon Web Services Certificate Manager (ACM) to use with services that are integrated with ACM. Note that <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-services.html">integrated services</a> allow only certificate types and keys they support to be associated with their resources. Further, their support differs depending on whether the certificate is imported into IAM or into ACM. For more information, see the documentation for each service. For more information about importing certificates into ACM, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html">Importing Certificates</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Certificate Manager User Guide</i>. <note> ACM does not provide <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-renewal.html">managed renewal</a> for certificates that you import. </note> Note the following guidelines when importing third party certificates: <ul> <li> You must enter the private key that matches the certificate you are importing. </li> <li> The private key must be unencrypted. You cannot import a private key that is protected by a password or a passphrase. </li> <li> The private key must be no larger than 5 KB (5,120 bytes). </li> <li> If the certificate you are importing is not self-signed, you must enter its certificate chain. </li> <li> If a certificate chain is included, the issuer must be the subject of one of the certificates in the chain. </li> <li> The certificate, private key, and certificate chain must be PEM-encoded. </li> <li> The current time must be between the <code>Not Before</code> and <code>Not After</code> certificate fields. </li> <li> The <code>Issuer</code> field must not be empty. </li> <li> The OCSP authority URL, if present, must not exceed 1000 characters. </li> <li> To import a new certificate, omit the <code>CertificateArn</code> argument. Include this argument only when you want to replace a previously imported certificate. </li> <li> When you import a certificate by using the CLI, you must specify the certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key by their file names preceded by <code>fileb://</code>. For example, you can specify a certificate saved in the <code>C:\temp</code> folder as <code>fileb://C:\temp\certificate_to_import.pem</code>. If you are making an HTTP or HTTPS Query request, include these arguments as BLOBs. </li> <li> When you import a certificate by using an SDK, you must specify the certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key files in the manner required by the programming language you're using. </li> <li> The cryptographic algorithm of an imported certificate must match the algorithm of the signing CA. For example, if the signing CA key type is RSA, then the certificate key type must also be RSA. </li> </ul> This operation returns the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon Resource Name (ARN)</a> of the imported certificate.

          Requests an ACM certificate for use with other Amazon Web Services services. To request an ACM certificate, you must specify a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in the <code>DomainName</code> parameter. You can also specify additional FQDNs in the <code>SubjectAlternativeNames</code> parameter. If you are requesting a private certificate, domain validation is not required. If you are requesting a public certificate, each domain name that you specify must be validated to verify that you own or control the domain. You can use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-dns.html">DNS validation</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-email.html">email validation</a>. We recommend that you use DNS validation. ACM issues public certificates after receiving approval from the domain owner. <note> ACM behavior differs from the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125#appendix-B.2">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125#appendix-B.2</a>RFC 6125 specification of the certificate validation process. first checks for a subject alternative name, and, if it finds one, ignores the common name (CN) </note>

          For each application, you define one or more environments. An environment is a logical deployment group of AppConfig targets, such as applications in a <code>Beta</code> or <code>Production</code> environment. You can also define environments for application subcomponents such as the <code>Web</code>, <code>Mobile</code> and <code>Back-end</code> components for your application. You can configure Amazon CloudWatch alarms for each environment. The system monitors alarms during a configuration deployment. If an alarm is triggered, the system rolls back the configuration.

          Receive information about a configuration. <important> AWS AppConfig uses the value of the <code>ClientConfigurationVersion</code> parameter to identify the configuration version on your clients. If you donâ€™t send <code>ClientConfigurationVersion</code> with each call to <code>GetConfiguration</code>, your clients receive the current configuration. You are charged each time your clients receive a configuration. To avoid excess charges, we recommend that you include the <code>ClientConfigurationVersion</code> value with every call to <code>GetConfiguration</code>. This value must be saved on your client. Subsequent calls to <code>GetConfiguration</code> must pass this value by using the <code>ClientConfigurationVersion</code> parameter. </important>

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Creates or updates a scaling policy for an Application Auto Scaling scalable target. Each scalable target is identified by a service namespace, resource ID, and scalable dimension. A scaling policy applies to the scalable target identified by those three attributes. You cannot create a scaling policy until you have registered the resource as a scalable target. Multiple scaling policies can be in force at the same time for the same scalable target. You can have one or more target tracking scaling policies, one or more step scaling policies, or both. However, there is a chance that multiple policies could conflict, instructing the scalable target to scale out or in at the same time. Application Auto Scaling gives precedence to the policy that provides the largest capacity for both scale out and scale in. For example, if one policy increases capacity by 3, another policy increases capacity by 200 percent, and the current capacity is 10, Application Auto Scaling uses the policy with the highest calculated capacity (200% of 10 = 20) and scales out to 30. We recommend caution, however, when using target tracking scaling policies with step scaling policies because conflicts between these policies can cause undesirable behavior. For example, if the step scaling policy initiates a scale-in activity before the target tracking policy is ready to scale in, the scale-in activity will not be blocked. After the scale-in activity completes, the target tracking policy could instruct the scalable target to scale out again. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/application-auto-scaling-target-tracking.html">Target tracking scaling policies</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/application-auto-scaling-step-scaling-policies.html">Step scaling policies</a> in the <i>Application Auto Scaling User Guide</i>. <note> If a scalable target is deregistered, the scalable target is no longer available to execute scaling policies. Any scaling policies that were specified for the scalable target are deleted. </note>

          Creates or updates a scheduled action for an Application Auto Scaling scalable target. Each scalable target is identified by a service namespace, resource ID, and scalable dimension. A scheduled action applies to the scalable target identified by those three attributes. You cannot create a scheduled action until you have registered the resource as a scalable target. When start and end times are specified with a recurring schedule using a cron expression or rates, they form the boundaries for when the recurring action starts and stops. To update a scheduled action, specify the parameters that you want to change. If you don't specify start and end times, the old values are deleted. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/application-auto-scaling-scheduled-scaling.html">Scheduled scaling</a> in the <i>Application Auto Scaling User Guide</i>. <note> If a scalable target is deregistered, the scalable target is no longer available to run scheduled actions.

          Creates a service mesh. A service mesh is a logical boundary for network traffic between services that are represented by resources within the mesh. After you create your service mesh, you can create virtual services, virtual nodes, virtual routers, and routes to distribute traffic between the applications in your mesh.

          Creates a virtual gateway. A virtual gateway allows resources outside your mesh to communicate to resources that are inside your mesh. The virtual gateway represents an Envoy proxy running in an Amazon ECS task, in a Kubernetes service, or on an Amazon EC2 instance. Unlike a virtual node, which represents an Envoy running with an application, a virtual gateway represents Envoy deployed by itself. For more information about virtual gateways, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/virtual_gateways.html">Virtual gateways</a>.

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Creates a virtual node within a service mesh. A virtual node acts as a logical pointer to a particular task group, such as an Amazon ECS service or a Kubernetes deployment. When you create a virtual node, you can specify the service discovery information for your task group, and whether the proxy running in a task group will communicate with other proxies using Transport Layer Security (TLS). You define a <code>listener</code> for any inbound traffic that your virtual node expects. Any virtual service that your virtual node expects to communicate to is specified as a <code>backend</code>. The response metadata for your new virtual node contains the <code>arn</code> that is associated with the virtual node. Set this value to the full ARN; for example, <code>arn:aws:appmesh:us-west-2:123456789012:myMesh/default/virtualNode/myApp</code>) as the <code>APPMESH_RESOURCE_ARN</code> environment variable for your task group's Envoy proxy container in your task definition or pod spec. This is then mapped to the <code>node.id</code> and <code>node.cluster</code> Envoy parameters. <note> By default, App Mesh uses the name of the resource you specified in <code>APPMESH_RESOURCE_ARN</code> when Envoy is referring to itself in metrics and traces. You can override this behavior by setting the <code>APPMESH_RESOURCE_CLUSTER</code> environment variable with your own name. </note> For more information about virtual nodes, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/virtual_nodes.html">Virtual nodes</a>. You must be using <code>1.15.0</code> or later of the Envoy image when setting these variables. For more information aboutApp Mesh Envoy variables, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/envoy.html">Envoy image</a> in the AWS App Mesh User Guide.

For each mapped domain name, add a mapping to the target App Runner subdomain and one or more certificate validation records. App Runner then performs DNS validation to verify that you own or control the domain name that you associated. App Runner tracks domain validity in a certificate stored in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide">AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)</a>.

          Create an App Runner automatic scaling configuration resource. App Runner requires this resource when you create App Runner services that require non-default auto scaling settings. You can share an auto scaling configuration across multiple services. Create multiple revisions of a configuration by using the same <code>AutoScalingConfigurationName</code> and different <code>AutoScalingConfigurationRevision</code> values. When you create a service, you can set it to use the latest active revision of an auto scaling configuration or a specific revision. Configure a higher <code>MinSize</code> to increase the spread of your App Runner service over more Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Services Region. The tradeoff is a higher minimal cost. Configure a lower <code>MaxSize</code> to control your cost. The tradeoff is lower responsiveness during peak demand.

          Adds one or more tags to an Athena resource. A tag is a label that you assign to a resource. In Athena, a resource can be a workgroup or data catalog. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you can use tags to categorize Athena workgroups or data catalogs by purpose, owner, or environment. Use a consistent set of tag keys to make it easier to search and filter workgroups or data catalogs in your account. For best practices, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/account-management/aws-tagging-strategies/">Tagging Best Practices</a>. Tag keys can be from 1 to 128 UTF-8 Unicode characters, and tag values can be from 0 to 256 UTF-8 Unicode characters. Tags can use letters and numbers representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @. Tag keys and values are case-sensitive. Tag keys must be unique per resource. If you specify more than one tag, separate them by commas.

This step is a part of the procedure for adding a lifecycle hook to an Auto Scaling group: <ol> <li> (Optional) Create a Lambda function and a rule that allows CloudWatch Events to invoke your Lambda function when Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches or terminates instances. </li> <li> (Optional) Create a notification target and an IAM role. The target can be either an Amazon SQS queue or an Amazon SNS topic. The role allows Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to publish lifecycle notifications to the target. </li> <li> <b>Create the lifecycle hook. Specify whether the hook is used when the instances launch or terminate.</b> </li> <li> If you need more time, record the lifecycle action heartbeat to keep the instance in a pending state using the <a>RecordLifecycleActionHeartbeat</a> API call. </li> <li> If you finish before the timeout period ends, complete the lifecycle action using the <a>CompleteLifecycleAction</a> API call. </li> </ol> For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html">Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide</i>. If you exceed your maximum limit of lifecycle hooks, which by default is 50 per Auto Scaling group, the call fails. You can view the lifecycle hooks for an Auto Scaling group using the <a>DescribeLifecycleHooks</a> API call. If you are no longer using a lifecycle hook, you can delete it by calling the <a>DeleteLifecycleHook</a> API.

          Starts a new instance refresh operation. An instance refresh performs a rolling replacement of all or some instances in an Auto Scaling group. Each instance is terminated first and then replaced, which temporarily reduces the capacity available within your Auto Scaling group. This operation is part of the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-refresh.html">instance refresh feature</a> in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, which helps you update instances in your Auto Scaling group. This feature is helpful, for example, when you have a new AMI or a new user data script. You just need to create a new launch template that specifies the new AMI or user data script. Then start an instance refresh to immediately begin the process of updating instances in the group. If the call succeeds, it creates a new instance refresh request with a unique ID that you can use to track its progress. To query its status, call the <a>DescribeInstanceRefreshes</a> API. To describe the instance refreshes that have already run, call the <a>DescribeInstanceRefreshes</a> API. To cancel an instance refresh operation in progress, use the <a>CancelInstanceRefresh</a> API.

          Terminates the specified instance and optionally adjusts the desired group size. This operation cannot be called on instances in a warm pool. This call simply makes a termination request. The instance is not terminated immediately. When an instance is terminated, the instance status changes to <code>terminated</code>. You can't connect to or start an instance after you've terminated it. If you do not specify the option to decrement the desired capacity, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches instances to replace the ones that are terminated. By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling balances instances across all Availability Zones. If you decrement the desired capacity, your Auto Scaling group can become unbalanced between Availability Zones. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling tries to rebalance the group, and rebalancing might terminate instances in other zones.

          Creates an Batch compute environment. You can create <code>MANAGED</code> or <code>UNMANAGED</code> compute environments. <code>MANAGED</code> compute environments can use Amazon EC2 or Fargate resources. <code>UNMANAGED</code> compute environments can only use EC2 resources. In a managed compute environment, Batch manages the capacity and instance types of the compute resources within the environment. This is based on the compute resource specification that you define or the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html">launch template</a> that you specify when you create the compute environment. Either, you can choose to use EC2 On-Demand Instances and EC2 Spot Instances. Or, you can use Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity in your managed compute environment. You can optionally set a maximum price so that Spot Instances only launch when the Spot Instance price is less than a specified percentage of the On-Demand price. <note> Multi-node parallel jobs aren't supported on Spot Instances. </note> In an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your own EC2 compute resources and have a lot of flexibility with how you configure your compute resources. For example, you can use custom AMIs. However, you must verify that each of your AMIs meet the Amazon ECS container instance AMI specification. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container_instance_AMIs.html">container instance AMIs</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>. After you created your unmanaged compute environment, you can use the <a>DescribeComputeEnvironments</a> operation to find the Amazon ECS cluster that's associated with it. Then, launch your container instances into that Amazon ECS cluster. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_container_instance.html">Launching an Amazon ECS container instance</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>. <note> Batch doesn't upgrade the AMIs in a compute environment after the environment is created. For example, it doesn't update the AMIs when a newer version of the Amazon ECS optimized AMI is available. Therefore, you're responsible for managing the guest operating system (including its updates and security patches) and any additional application software or utilities that you install on the compute resources. To use a new AMI for your Batch jobs, complete these steps: <ol> <li> Create a new compute environment with the new AMI. </li> <li> Add the compute environment to an existing job queue. </li> <li> Remove the earlier compute environment from your job queue. </li> <li> Delete the earlier compute environment. </li> </ol> </note>

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Creates an Batch job queue. When you create a job queue, you associate one or more compute environments to the queue and assign an order of preference for the compute environments. You also set a priority to the job queue that determines the order that the Batch scheduler places jobs onto its associated compute environments. For example, if a compute environment is associated with more than one job queue, the job queue with a higher priority is given preference for scheduling jobs to that compute environment.

Before you can delete a compute environment, you must set its state to <code>DISABLED</code> with the <a>UpdateComputeEnvironment</a> API operation and disassociate it from any job queues with the <a>UpdateJobQueue</a> API operation. Compute environments that use Fargate resources must terminate all active jobs on that compute environment before deleting the compute environment.

          For a specified stack that is in the <code>UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED</code> state, continues rolling it back to the <code>UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE</code> state. Depending on the cause of the failure, you can manually <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-errors-update-rollback-failed"> fix the error</a> and continue the rollback. By continuing the rollback, you can return your stack to a working state (the <code>UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE</code> state), and then try to update the stack again. A stack goes into the <code>UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED</code> state when CloudFormation cannot roll back all changes after a failed stack update. For example, you might have a stack that is rolling back to an old database instance that was deleted outside of CloudFormation. Because CloudFormation doesn't know the database was deleted, it assumes that the database instance still exists and attempts to roll back to it, causing the update rollback to fail.

          Creates a list of changes that will be applied to a stack so that you can review the changes before executing them. You can create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist or an existing stack. If you create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, the change set shows all of the resources that CloudFormation will create. If you create a change set for an existing stack, CloudFormation compares the stack's information with the information that you submit in the change set and lists the differences. Use change sets to understand which resources CloudFormation will create or change, and how it will change resources in an existing stack, before you create or update a stack. To create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, for the <code>ChangeSetType</code> parameter, specify <code>CREATE</code>. To create a change set for an existing stack, specify <code>UPDATE</code> for the <code>ChangeSetType</code> parameter. To create a change set for an import operation, specify <code>IMPORT</code> for the <code>ChangeSetType</code> parameter. After the <code>CreateChangeSet</code> call successfully completes, CloudFormation starts creating the change set. To check the status of the change set or to review it, use the <a>DescribeChangeSet</a> action. When you are satisfied with the changes the change set will make, execute the change set by using the <a>ExecuteChangeSet</a> action. CloudFormation doesn't make changes until you execute the change set. To create a change set for the entire stack hierachy, set <code>IncludeNestedStacks</code> to <code>True</code>.

In addition, deactivated extensions are not automatically updated if a new version of the extension is released.

Deprecated extensions or extension versions cannot be used in CloudFormation operations. To deregister an entire extension, you must individually deregister all active versions of that extension. If an extension has only a single active version, deregistering that version results in the extension itself being deregistered and marked as deprecated in the registry. You cannot deregister the default version of an extension if there are other active version of that extension. If you do deregister the default version of an extension, the textensionype itself is deregistered as well and marked as deprecated.

          Detects whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has <i>drifted</i>, from it's expected configuration, as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template parameters. For each resource in the stack that supports drift detection, CloudFormation compares the actual configuration of the resource with its expected template configuration. Only resource properties explicitly defined in the stack template are checked for drift. A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its resources differ from their expected template configurations. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html">Detecting Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources</a>. Use <code>DetectStackDrift</code> to detect drift on all supported resources for a given stack, or <a>DetectStackResourceDrift</a> to detect drift on individual resources.

Use <a>DescribeStackDriftDetectionStatus</a> to monitor the progress of a detect stack drift operation. Once the drift detection operation has completed, use <a>DescribeStackResourceDrifts</a> to return drift information about the stack and its resources. When detecting drift on a stack, CloudFormation does not detect drift on any nested stacks belonging to that stack. Perform <code>DetectStackDrift</code> directly on the nested stack itself.

For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-drift.html">How CloudFormation Performs Drift Detection on a Stack Set</a>. <code>DetectStackSetDrift</code> returns the <code>OperationId</code> of the stack set drift detection operation.

The drift detection operation may take some time, depending on the number of stack instances included in the stack set, as well as the number of resources included in each stack. Once the operation has completed, use the following actions to return drift information: <ul> <li> Use <code> <a>DescribeStackSet</a> </code> to return detailed information about the stack set, including detailed information about the last <i>completed</i> drift operation performed on the stack set. (Information about drift operations that are in progress is not included.) </li> <li> Use <code> <a>ListStackInstances</a> </code> to return a list of stack instances belonging to the stack set, including the drift status and last drift time checked of each instance. </li> <li> Use <code> <a>DescribeStackInstance</a> </code> to return detailed information about a specific stack instance, including its drift status and last drift time checked. </li> </ul> For more information on performing a drift detection operation on a stack set, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-drift.html">Detecting Unmanaged Changes in Stack Sets</a>.

          Creates a cache policy. After you create a cache policy, you can attach it to one or more cache behaviors. When itâ€™s attached to a cache behavior, the cache policy determines the following: <ul> <li> The values that CloudFront includes in the <i>cache key</i>. These values can include HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings. CloudFront uses the cache key to find an object in its cache that it can return to the viewer. </li> <li> The default, minimum, and maximum time to live (TTL) values that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache. </li> </ul> The headers, cookies, and query strings that are included in the cache key are automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. CloudFront sends a request when it canâ€™t find an object in its cache that matches the requestâ€™s cache key. If you want to send values to the origin but <i>not</i> include them in the cache key, use <code>OriginRequestPolicy</code>.

In the returned list, the distribution and account IDs are partially hidden, which allows you to identify the distributions and accounts that you own, but helps to protect the information of ones that you donâ€™t own. Use this operation to find aliases that are in use in CloudFront that conflict or overlap with the provided alias. For example, if you provide <code>www.example.com</code> as input, the returned list can include <code>www.example.com</code> and the overlapping wildcard alternate domain name (<code>*.example.com</code>), if they exist. If you provide <code>*.example.com</code> as input, the returned list can include <code>*.example.com</code> and any alternate domain names covered by that wildcard (for example, <code>www.example.com</code>, <code>test.example.com</code>, <code>dev.example.com</code>, and so on), if they exist. To list conflicting aliases, you provide the alias to search and the ID of a distribution in your account that has an attached SSL/TLS certificate that includes the provided alias. For more information, including how to set up the distribution and certificate, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html#alternate-domain-names-move">Moving an alternate domain name to a different distribution</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide</i>.

          Updates the configuration for a web distribution. <important> When you update a distribution, there are more required fields than when you create a distribution. When you update your distribution by using this API action, follow the steps here to get the current configuration and then make your updates, to make sure that you include all of the required fields. To view a summary, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-overview-required-fields.html">Required Fields for Create Distribution and Update Distribution</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide</i>. </important> The update process includes getting the current distribution configuration, updating the XML document that is returned to make your changes, and then submitting an <code>UpdateDistribution</code> request to make the updates. For information about updating a distribution using the CloudFront console instead, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-creating-console.html">Creating a Distribution</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide</i>. <b>To update a web distribution using the CloudFront API</b> <ol> <li> Submit a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_GetDistributionConfig.html">GetDistributionConfig</a> request to get the current configuration and an <code>Etag</code> header for the distribution. <note> If you update the distribution again, you must get a new <code>Etag</code> header. </note> </li> <li> Update the XML document that was returned in the response to your <code>GetDistributionConfig</code> request to include your changes. <important> When you edit the XML file, be aware of the following: <ul> <li> You must strip out the ETag parameter that is returned. </li> <li> Additional fields are required when you update a distribution. There may be fields included in the XML file for features that you haven't configured for your distribution. This is expected and required to successfully update the distribution. </li> <li> You can't change the value of <code>CallerReference</code>. If you try to change this value, CloudFront returns an <code>IllegalUpdate</code> error. </li> <li> The new configuration replaces the existing configuration; the values that you specify in an <code>UpdateDistribution</code> request are not merged into your existing configuration. When you add, delete, or replace values in an element that allows multiple values (for example, <code>CNAME</code>), you must specify all of the values that you want to appear in the updated distribution. In addition, you must update the corresponding <code>Quantity</code> element. </li> </ul> </important> </li> <li> Submit an <code>UpdateDistribution</code> request to update the configuration for your distribution: <ul> <li> In the request body, include the XML document that you updated in Step 2. The request body must include an XML document with a <code>DistributionConfig</code> element. </li> <li> Set the value of the HTTP <code>If-Match</code> header to the value of the <code>ETag</code> header that CloudFront returned when you submitted the <code>GetDistributionConfig</code> request in Step 1. </li> </ul> </li> <li> Review the response to the <code>UpdateDistribution</code> request to confirm that the configuration was successfully updated. </li> <li> Optional: Submit a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_GetDistribution.html">GetDistribution</a> request to confirm that your changes have propagated. When propagation is complete, the value of <code>Status</code> is <code>Deployed</code>. </li> </ol>

          Retrieves a list of documents that match the specified search criteria. How you specify the search criteria depends on which query parser you use. Amazon CloudSearch supports four query parsers: <ul> <li><code>simple</code>: search all <code>text</code> and <code>text-array</code> fields for the specified string. Search for phrases, individual terms, and prefixes. </li> <li><code>structured</code>: search specific fields, construct compound queries using Boolean operators, and use advanced features such as term boosting and proximity searching.</li> <li><code>lucene</code>: specify search criteria using the Apache Lucene query parser syntax.</li> <li><code>dismax</code>: specify search criteria using the simplified subset of the Apache Lucene query parser syntax defined by the DisMax query parser.</li> </ul> For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/latest/developerguide/searching.html">Searching Your Data</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide</i>. The endpoint for submitting <code>Search</code> requests is domain-specific. You submit search requests to a domain's search endpoint. To get the search endpoint for your domain, use the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service <code>DescribeDomains</code> action. A domain's endpoints are also displayed on the domain dashboard in the Amazon CloudSearch console.

          You can use the <code>GetMetricData</code> API to retrieve as many as 500 different metrics in a single request, with a total of as many as 100,800 data points. You can also optionally perform math expressions on the values of the returned statistics, to create new time series that represent new insights into your data. For example, using Lambda metrics, you could divide the Errors metric by the Invocations metric to get an error rate time series. For more information about metric math expressions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax">Metric Math Syntax and Functions</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch User Guide</i>. Calls to the <code>GetMetricData</code> API have a different pricing structure than calls to <code>GetMetricStatistics</code>. For more information about pricing, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/">Amazon CloudWatch Pricing</a>. Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows: <ul> <li> Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a <code>StorageResolution</code> of 1. </li> <li> Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15 days. </li> <li> Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63 days. </li> <li> Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months). </li> </ul> Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour. If you omit <code>Unit</code> in your request, all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

          Gets statistics for the specified metric. The maximum number of data points returned from a single call is 1,440. If you request more than 1,440 data points, CloudWatch returns an error. To reduce the number of data points, you can narrow the specified time range and make multiple requests across adjacent time ranges, or you can increase the specified period. Data points are not returned in chronological order. CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period that you specify. For example, if you request statistics with a one-hour period, CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time stamps that fall within each one-hour period. Therefore, the number of values aggregated by CloudWatch is larger than the number of data points returned. CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true: <ul> <li> The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1. </li> <li> The Min and the Max values of the statistic set are equal. </li> </ul> Percentile statistics are not available for metrics when any of the metric values are negative numbers. Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows: <ul> <li> Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a <code>StorageResolution</code> of 1. </li> <li> Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15 days. </li> <li> Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63 days. </li> <li> Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months). </li> </ul> Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour. CloudWatch started retaining 5-minute and 1-hour metric data as of July 9, 2016.

All dashboards in your account are global, not region-specific. A simple way to create a dashboard using <code>PutDashboard</code> is to copy an existing dashboard. To copy an existing dashboard using the console, you can load the dashboard and then use the View/edit source command in the Actions menu to display the JSON block for that dashboard. Another way to copy a dashboard is to use <code>GetDashboard</code>, and then use the data returned within <code>DashboardBody</code> as the template for the new dashboard when you call <code>PutDashboard</code>. When you create a dashboard with <code>PutDashboard</code>, a good practice is to add a text widget at the top of the dashboard with a message that the dashboard was created by script and should not be changed in the console. This message could also point console users to the location of the <code>DashboardBody</code> script or the CloudFormation template used to create the dashboard.

For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Metric-Streams.html"> Using Metric Streams</a>. To create a metric stream, you must be logged on to an account that has the <code>iam:PassRole</code> permission and either the <code>CloudWatchFullAccess</code> policy or the <code>cloudwatch:PutMetricStream</code> permission. When you create or update a metric stream, you choose one of the following: <ul> <li> Stream metrics from all metric namespaces in the account. </li> <li> Stream metrics from all metric namespaces in the account, except for the namespaces that you list in <code>ExcludeFilters</code>. </li> <li> Stream metrics from only the metric namespaces that you list in <code>IncludeFilters</code>. </li> </ul> When you use <code>PutMetricStream</code> to create a new metric stream, the stream is created in the <code>running</code> state. If you use it to update an existing stream, the state of the stream is not changed.

          Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified CloudWatch resource. Currently, the only CloudWatch resources that can be tagged are alarms and Contributor Insights rules. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters. You can use the <code>TagResource</code> action with an alarm that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the alarm, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the alarm. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the alarm, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag. You can associate as many as 50 tags with a CloudWatch resource.

          Creates a domain. CodeArtifact <i>domains</i> make it easier to manage multiple repositories across an organization. You can use a domain to apply permissions across many repositories owned by different AWS accounts. An asset is stored only once in a domain, even if it's in multiple repositories. Although you can have multiple domains, we recommend a single production domain that contains all published artifacts so that your development teams can find and share packages. You can use a second pre-production domain to test changes to the production domain configuration.

          Generates a temporary authorization token for accessing repositories in the domain. This API requires the <code>codeartifact:GetAuthorizationToken</code> and <code>sts:GetServiceBearerToken</code> permissions. For more information about authorization tokens, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/tokens-authentication.html">AWS CodeArtifact authentication and tokens</a>. <note> CodeArtifact authorization tokens are valid for a period of 12 hours when created with the <code>login</code> command. You can call <code>login</code> periodically to refresh the token. When you create an authorization token with the <code>GetAuthorizationToken</code> API, you can set a custom authorization period, up to a maximum of 12 hours, with the <code>durationSeconds</code> parameter. The authorization period begins after <code>login</code> or <code>GetAuthorizationToken</code> is called. If <code>login</code> or <code>GetAuthorizationToken</code> is called while assuming a role, the token lifetime is independent of the maximum session duration of the role. For example, if you call <code>sts assume-role</code> and specify a session duration of 15 minutes, then generate a CodeArtifact authorization token, the token will be valid for the full authorization period even though this is longer than the 15-minute session duration. See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html">Using IAM Roles</a> for more information on controlling session duration. </note>

          For an existing CodeBuild build project that has its source code stored in a GitHub or Bitbucket repository, enables CodeBuild to start rebuilding the source code every time a code change is pushed to the repository. <important> If you enable webhooks for an CodeBuild project, and the project is used as a build step in CodePipeline, then two identical builds are created for each commit. One build is triggered through webhooks, and one through CodePipeline. Because billing is on a per-build basis, you are billed for both builds. Therefore, if you are using CodePipeline, we recommend that you disable webhooks in CodeBuild. In the CodeBuild console, clear the Webhook box.

          Changes the public visibility for a project. The project's build results, logs, and artifacts are available to the general public. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/public-builds.html">Public build projects</a> in the <i>CodeBuild User Guide</i>. <important> The following should be kept in mind when making your projects public: <ul> <li> All of a project's build results, logs, and artifacts, including builds that were run when the project was private, are available to the general public. </li> <li> All build logs and artifacts are available to the public. Environment variables, source code, and other sensitive information may have been output to the build logs and artifacts. You must be careful about what information is output to the build logs. Some best practice are: <ul> <li> Do not store sensitive values, especially Amazon Web Services access key IDs and secret access keys, in environment variables. We recommend that you use an Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store or Secrets Manager to store sensitive values. </li> <li> Follow <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/webhooks.html#webhook-best-practices">Best practices for using webhooks</a> in the <i>CodeBuild User Guide</i> to limit which entities can trigger a build, and do not store the buildspec in the project itself, to ensure that your webhooks are as secure as possible. </li> </ul> </li> <li> A malicious user can use public builds to distribute malicious artifacts. We recommend that you review all pull requests to verify that the pull request is a legitimate change. We also recommend that you validate any artifacts with their checksums to make sure that the correct artifacts are being downloaded. </li> </ul> </important>

          Use to associate an Amazon Web Services CodeCommit repository or a repostory managed by Amazon Web Services CodeStar Connections with Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer. When you associate a repository, CodeGuru Reviewer reviews source code changes in the repository's pull requests and provides automatic recommendations. You can view recommendations using the CodeGuru Reviewer console. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/recommendations.html">Recommendations in Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer</a> in the <i>Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide.</i> If you associate a CodeCommit or S3 repository, it must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region and Amazon Web Services account where its CodeGuru Reviewer code reviews are configured. Bitbucket and GitHub Enterprise Server repositories are managed by Amazon Web Services CodeStar Connections to connect to CodeGuru Reviewer. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/getting-started-associate-repository.html">Associate a repository</a> in the <i>Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide.</i> <note> You cannot use the CodeGuru Reviewer SDK or the Amazon Web Services CLI to associate a GitHub repository with Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer.

          Gets the aggregated profile of a profiling group for a specified time range. Amazon CodeGuru Profiler collects posted agent profiles for a profiling group into aggregated profiles. <pre><code> &lt;note&gt; &lt;p&gt; Because aggregated profiles expire over time &lt;code&gt;GetProfile&lt;/code&gt; is not idempotent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/note&gt; &lt;p&gt; Specify the time range for the requested aggregated profile using 1 or 2 of the following parameters: &lt;code&gt;startTime&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;endTime&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;period&lt;/code&gt;. The maximum time range allowed is 7 days. If you specify all 3 parameters, an exception is thrown. If you specify only &lt;code&gt;period&lt;/code&gt;, the latest aggregated profile is returned. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Aggregated profiles are available with aggregation periods of 5 minutes, 1 hour, and 1 day, aligned to UTC. The aggregation period of an aggregated profile determines how long it is retained. For more information, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/profiler-api/API_AggregatedProfileTime.html&quot;&gt; &lt;code&gt;AggregatedProfileTime&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/a&gt;. The aggregated profile's aggregation period determines how long it is retained by CodeGuru Profiler. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; If the aggregation period is 5 minutes, the aggregated profile is retained for 15 days. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; If the aggregation period is 1 hour, the aggregated profile is retained for 60 days. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; If the aggregation period is 1 day, the aggregated profile is retained for 3 years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are two use cases for calling &lt;code&gt;GetProfile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to return an aggregated profile that already exists, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/profiler-api/API_ListProfileTimes.html&quot;&gt; &lt;code&gt;ListProfileTimes&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/a&gt; to view the time ranges of existing aggregated profiles. Use them in a &lt;code&gt;GetProfile&lt;/code&gt; request to return a specific, existing aggregated profile. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you want to return an aggregated profile for a time range that doesn't align with an existing aggregated profile, then CodeGuru Profiler makes a best effort to combine existing aggregated profiles from the requested time range and return them as one aggregated profile. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If aggregated profiles do not exist for the full time range requested, then aggregated profiles for a smaller time range are returned. For example, if the requested time range is from 00:00 to 00:20, and the existing aggregated profiles are from 00:15 and 00:25, then the aggregated profiles from 00:15 to 00:20 are returned. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; </code></pre>

          Registers (or retrieves) a Cognito <code>IdentityId</code> and an OpenID Connect token for a user authenticated by your backend authentication process. Supplying multiple logins will create an implicit linked account. You can only specify one developer provider as part of the <code>Logins</code> map, which is linked to the identity pool. The developer provider is the "domain" by which Cognito will refer to your users. You can use <code>GetOpenIdTokenForDeveloperIdentity</code> to create a new identity and to link new logins (that is, user credentials issued by a public provider or developer provider) to an existing identity. When you want to create a new identity, the <code>IdentityId</code> should be null. When you want to associate a new login with an existing authenticated/unauthenticated identity, you can do so by providing the existing <code>IdentityId</code>. This API will create the identity in the specified <code>IdentityPoolId</code>. You must use AWS Developer credentials to call this API.

Either <code>IdentityID</code> or <code>DeveloperUserIdentifier</code> must not be null. If you supply only one of these values, the other value will be searched in the database and returned as a part of the response. If you supply both, <code>DeveloperUserIdentifier</code> will be matched against <code>IdentityID</code>. If the values are verified against the database, the response returns both values and is the same as the request. Otherwise a <code>ResourceConflictException</code> is thrown. <code>LookupDeveloperIdentity</code> is intended for low-throughput control plane operations: for example, to enable customer service to locate an identity ID by username. If you are using it for higher-volume operations such as user authentication, your requests are likely to be throttled. <a>GetOpenIdTokenForDeveloperIdentity</a> is a better option for higher-volume operations for user authentication.

          Merges two users having different <code>IdentityId</code>s, existing in the same identity pool, and identified by the same developer provider. You can use this action to request that discrete users be merged and identified as a single user in the Cognito environment. Cognito associates the given source user (<code>SourceUserIdentifier</code>) with the <code>IdentityId</code> of the <code>DestinationUserIdentifier</code>. Only developer-authenticated users can be merged. If the users to be merged are associated with the same public provider, but as two different users, an exception will be thrown. The number of linked logins is limited to 20. So, the number of linked logins for the source user, <code>SourceUserIdentifier</code>, and the destination user, <code>DestinationUserIdentifier</code>, together should not be larger than 20. Otherwise, an exception will be thrown. You must use AWS Developer credentials to call this API.

          Assigns a set of tags to the specified Amazon Cognito identity pool. A tag is a label that you can use to categorize and manage identity pools in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. Each tag consists of a key and value, both of which you define. A key is a general category for more specific values. For example, if you have two versions of an identity pool, one for testing and another for production, you might assign an <code>Environment</code> tag key to both identity pools. The value of this key might be <code>Test</code> for one identity pool and <code>Production</code> for the other. Tags are useful for cost tracking and access control. You can activate your tags so that they appear on the Billing and Cost Management console, where you can track the costs associated with your identity pools. In an IAM policy, you can constrain permissions for identity pools based on specific tags or tag values. You can use this action up to 5 times per second, per account. An identity pool can have as many as 50 tags.

You can only associate one type of storage configuration in a single call. This means, for example, that you can't define an instance with multiple S3 buckets for storing chat transcripts. This API does not create a resource that doesn't exist. It only associates it to the instance. Ensure that the resource being specified in the storage configuration, like an S3 bucket, exists when being used for association.

Agents do not initiate the outbound API, which means that they do not dial the contact. If the contact flow places an outbound call to a contact, and then puts the contact in queue, the call is then routed to the agent, like any other inbound case. There is a 60-second dialing timeout for this operation. If the call is not connected after 60 seconds, it fails. <note> UK numbers with a 447 prefix are not allowed by default. Before you can dial these UK mobile numbers, you must submit a service quota increase request.

For example, while the call is active, you can update the customer's name or the reason the customer called. You can add notes about steps that the agent took during the call that display to the next agent that takes the call. You can also update attributes for a contact using data from your CRM application and save the data with the contact in Amazon Connect. You could also flag calls for additional analysis, such as legal review or to identify abusive callers. Contact attributes are available in Amazon Connect for 24 months, and are then deleted. For information about CTR retention and the maximum size of the CTR attributes section, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html#feature-limits">Feature specifications</a> in the <i>Amazon Connect Administrator Guide</i>. <b>Important:</b> You cannot use the operation to update attributes for contacts that occurred prior to the release of the API, which was September 12, 2018. You can update attributes only for contacts that started after the release of the API. If you attempt to update attributes for a contact that occurred prior to the release of the API, a 400 error is returned. This applies also to queued callbacks that were initiated prior to the release of the API but are still active in your instance.

          Creates the participant's connection. Note that ParticipantToken is used for invoking this API instead of ConnectionToken. The participant token is valid for the lifetime of the participant â€“ until they are part of a contact. The response URL for <code>WEBSOCKET</code> Type has a connect expiry timeout of 100s. Clients must manually connect to the returned websocket URL and subscribe to the desired topic. For chat, you need to publish the following on the established websocket connection: <code>{"topic":"aws/subscribe","content":{"topics":["aws/chat"]}}</code> Upon websocket URL expiry, as specified in the response ConnectionExpiry parameter, clients need to call this API again to obtain a new websocket URL and perform the same steps as before. <b>Message streaming support</b>: This API can also be used together with the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_StartContactStreaming.html">StartContactStreaming</a> API to create a participant connection for chat contacts that are not using a websocket. For more information about message streaming, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/chat-message-streaming.html">Enable real-time chat message streaming</a> in the <i>Amazon Connect Administrator Guide</i>. <b>Feature specifications</b>: For information about feature specifications, such as the allowed number of open websocket connections per participant, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html#feature-limits">Feature specifications</a> in the <i>Amazon Connect Administrator Guide</i>. <note> The Amazon Connect Participant Service APIs do not use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 authentication</a>. </note>

          Task runners call <code>PollForTask</code> to receive a task to perform from AWS Data Pipeline. The task runner specifies which tasks it can perform by setting a value for the <code>workerGroup</code> parameter. The task returned can come from any of the pipelines that match the <code>workerGroup</code> value passed in by the task runner and that was launched using the IAM user credentials specified by the task runner. If tasks are ready in the work queue, <code>PollForTask</code> returns a response immediately. If no tasks are available in the queue, <code>PollForTask</code> uses long-polling and holds on to a poll connection for up to a 90 seconds, during which time the first newly scheduled task is handed to the task runner. To accomodate this, set the socket timeout in your task runner to 90 seconds. The task runner should not call <code>PollForTask</code> again on the same <code>workerGroup</code> until it receives a response, and this can take up to 90 seconds.

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Task runners call <code>ReportTaskProgress</code> when assigned a task to acknowledge that it has the task. If the web service does not receive this acknowledgement within 2 minutes, it assigns the task in a subsequent <a>PollForTask</a> call. After this initial acknowledgement, the task runner only needs to report progress every 15 minutes to maintain its ownership of the task. You can change this reporting time from 15 minutes by specifying a <code>reportProgressTimeout</code> field in your pipeline. If a task runner does not report its status after 5 minutes, AWS Data Pipeline assumes that the task runner is unable to process the task and reassigns the task in a subsequent response to <a>PollForTask</a>. Task runners should call <code>ReportTaskProgress</code> every 60 seconds.

          Cancels execution of a task. When you cancel a task execution, the transfer of some files is abruptly interrupted. The contents of files that are transferred to the destination might be incomplete or inconsistent with the source files. However, if you start a new task execution on the same task and you allow the task execution to complete, file content on the destination is complete and consistent. This applies to other unexpected failures that interrupt a task execution. In all of these cases, DataSync successfully complete the transfer when you start the next task execution.

          Activates an DataSync agent that you have deployed on your host. The activation process associates your agent with your account. In the activation process, you specify information such as the Amazon Web Services Region that you want to activate the agent in. You activate the agent in the Amazon Web Services Region where your target locations (in Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS) reside. Your tasks are created in this Amazon Web Services Region. You can activate the agent in a VPC (virtual private cloud) or provide the agent access to a VPC endpoint so you can run tasks without going over the public internet. You can use an agent for more than one location. If a task uses multiple agents, all of them need to have status AVAILABLE for the task to run. If you use multiple agents for a source location, the status of all the agents must be AVAILABLE for the task to run. Agents are automatically updated by Amazon Web Services on a regular basis, using a mechanism that ensures minimal interruption to your tasks. <p/>

          Creates a task. A task includes a source location and a destination location, and a configuration that specifies how data is transferred. A task always transfers data from the source location to the destination location. The configuration specifies options such as task scheduling, bandwidth limits, etc. A task is the complete definition of a data transfer. When you create a task that transfers data between Amazon Web Services services in different Amazon Web Services Regions, one of the two locations that you specify must reside in the Region where DataSync is being used. The other location must be specified in a different Region. You can transfer data between commercial Amazon Web Services Regions except for China, or between Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions. <important> When you use DataSync to copy files or objects between Amazon Web Services Regions, you pay for data transfer between Regions. This is billed as data transfer OUT from your source Region to your destination Region.

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Creates a new behavior graph for the calling account, and sets that account as the administrator account. This operation is called by the account that is enabling Detective. Before you try to enable Detective, make sure that your account has been enrolled in Amazon GuardDuty for at least 48 hours. If you do not meet this requirement, you cannot enable Detective. If you do meet the GuardDuty prerequisite, then when you make the request to enable Detective, it checks whether your data volume is within the Detective quota. If it exceeds the quota, then you cannot enable Detective. The operation also enables Detective for the calling account in the currently selected Region. It returns the ARN of the new behavior graph. <code>CreateGraph</code> triggers a process to create the corresponding data tables for the new behavior graph. An account can only be the administrator account for one behavior graph within a Region. If the same account calls <code>CreateGraph</code> with the same administrator account, it always returns the same behavior graph ARN. It does not create a new behavior graph.

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Sends a request to invite the specified AWS accounts to be member accounts in the behavior graph. This operation can only be called by the administrator account for a behavior graph. <code>CreateMembers</code> verifies the accounts and then invites the verified accounts. The administrator can optionally specify to not send invitation emails to the member accounts. This would be used when the administrator manages their member accounts centrally. The request provides the behavior graph ARN and the list of accounts to invite. The response separates the requested accounts into two lists: <ul> <li> The accounts that <code>CreateMembers</code> was able to start the verification for. This list includes member accounts that are being verified, that have passed verification and are to be invited, and that have failed verification. </li> <li> The accounts that <code>CreateMembers</code> was unable to process. This list includes accounts that were already invited to be member accounts in the behavior graph. </li> </ul>

          Deletes one or more member accounts from the administrator account's behavior graph. This operation can only be called by a Detective administrator account. That account cannot use <code>DeleteMembers</code> to delete their own account from the behavior graph. To disable a behavior graph, the administrator account uses the <code>DeleteGraph</code> API method.

          Adds a notification channel to DevOps Guru. A notification channel is used to notify you about important DevOps Guru events, such as when an insight is generated. If you use an Amazon SNS topic in another account, you must attach a policy to it that grants DevOps Guru permission to it notifications. DevOps Guru adds the required policy on your behalf to send notifications using Amazon SNS in your account. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/sns-required-permissions.html">Permissions for cross account Amazon SNS topics</a>. If you use an Amazon SNS topic that is encrypted by an AWS Key Management Service customer-managed key (CMK), then you must add permissions to the CMK. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/sns-kms-permissions.html">Permissions for AWS KMSâ€“encrypted Amazon SNS topics</a>.

The connection is interrupted and re-established as a member of the LAG (connectivity to Amazon Web Services is interrupted). The connection must be hosted on the same Direct Connect endpoint as the LAG, and its bandwidth must match the bandwidth for the LAG. You can re-associate a connection that's currently associated with a different LAG; however, if removing the connection would cause the original LAG to fall below its setting for minimum number of operational connections, the request fails. Any virtual interfaces that are directly associated with the connection are automatically re-associated with the LAG. If the connection was originally associated with a different LAG, the virtual interfaces remain associated with the original LAG. For interconnects, any hosted connections are automatically re-associated with the LAG. If the interconnect was originally associated with a different LAG, the hosted connections remain associated with the original LAG.

          Creates an interconnect between an Direct Connect Partner's network and a specific Direct Connect location. An interconnect is a connection that is capable of hosting other connections. The Direct Connect Partner can use an interconnect to provide Direct Connect hosted connections to customers through their own network services. Like a standard connection, an interconnect links the partner's network to an Direct Connect location over a standard Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end is connected to the partner's router, the other to an Direct Connect router. You can automatically add the new interconnect to a link aggregation group (LAG) by specifying a LAG ID in the request. This ensures that the new interconnect is allocated on the same Direct Connect endpoint that hosts the specified LAG. If there are no available ports on the endpoint, the request fails and no interconnect is created. For each end customer, the Direct Connect Partner provisions a connection on their interconnect by calling <a>AllocateHostedConnection</a>. The end customer can then connect to Amazon Web Services resources by creating a virtual interface on their connection, using the VLAN assigned to them by the Direct Connect Partner. <note> Intended for use by Direct Connect Partners only. </note>

          Creates a link aggregation group (LAG) with the specified number of bundled physical dedicated connections between the customer network and a specific Direct Connect location. A LAG is a logical interface that uses the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) to aggregate multiple interfaces, enabling you to treat them as a single interface. All connections in a LAG must use the same bandwidth (either 1Gbps or 10Gbps) and must terminate at the same Direct Connect endpoint. You can have up to 10 dedicated connections per LAG. Regardless of this limit, if you request more connections for the LAG than Direct Connect can allocate on a single endpoint, no LAG is created. You can specify an existing physical dedicated connection or interconnect to include in the LAG (which counts towards the total number of connections). Doing so interrupts the current physical dedicated connection, and re-establishes them as a member of the LAG. The LAG will be created on the same Direct Connect endpoint to which the dedicated connection terminates. Any virtual interfaces associated with the dedicated connection are automatically disassociated and re-associated with the LAG. The connection ID does not change. If the Amazon Web Services account used to create a LAG is a registered Direct Connect Partner, the LAG is automatically enabled to host sub-connections. For a LAG owned by a partner, any associated virtual interfaces cannot be directly configured.

          Creates a private virtual interface. A virtual interface is the VLAN that transports Direct Connect traffic. A private virtual interface can be connected to either a Direct Connect gateway or a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW). Connecting the private virtual interface to a Direct Connect gateway enables the possibility for connecting to multiple VPCs, including VPCs in different Amazon Web Services Regions. Connecting the private virtual interface to a VGW only provides access to a single VPC within the same Region. Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 9001 (jumbo frames) can cause an update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't updated to support jumbo frames. Updating the connection disrupts network connectivity for all virtual interfaces associated with the connection for up to 30 seconds. To check whether your connection supports jumbo frames, call <a>DescribeConnections</a>. To check whether your virtual interface supports jumbo frames, call <a>DescribeVirtualInterfaces</a>.

          Disassociates a connection from a link aggregation group (LAG). The connection is interrupted and re-established as a standalone connection (the connection is not deleted; to delete the connection, use the <a>DeleteConnection</a> request). If the LAG has associated virtual interfaces or hosted connections, they remain associated with the LAG. A disassociated connection owned by an Direct Connect Partner is automatically converted to an interconnect. If disassociating the connection would cause the LAG to fall below its setting for minimum number of operational connections, the request fails, except when it's the last member of the LAG. If all connections are disassociated, the LAG continues to exist as an empty LAG with no physical connections.

A cluster parameter group is initially created with the default parameters for the database engine used by instances in the cluster. In Amazon DocumentDB, you cannot make modifications directly to the <code>default.docdb3.6</code> cluster parameter group. If your Amazon DocumentDB cluster is using the default cluster parameter group and you want to modify a value in it, you must first <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/cluster_parameter_group-create.html"> create a new parameter group</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/cluster_parameter_group-copy.html"> copy an existing parameter group</a>, modify it, and then apply the modified parameter group to your cluster. For the new cluster parameter group and associated settings to take effect, you must then reboot the instances in the cluster without failover.

          Creates an Amazon DocumentDB event notification subscription. This action requires a topic Amazon Resource Name (ARN) created by using the Amazon DocumentDB console, the Amazon SNS console, or the Amazon SNS API. To obtain an ARN with Amazon SNS, you must create a topic in Amazon SNS and subscribe to the topic. The ARN is displayed in the Amazon SNS console. You can specify the type of source (<code>SourceType</code>) that you want to be notified of. You can also provide a list of Amazon DocumentDB sources (<code>SourceIds</code>) that trigger the events, and you can provide a list of event categories (<code>EventCategories</code>) for events that you want to be notified of. For example, you can specify <code>SourceType = db-instance</code>, <code>SourceIds = mydbinstance1, mydbinstance2</code> and <code>EventCategories = Availability, Backup</code>. If you specify both the <code>SourceType</code> and <code>SourceIds</code> (such as <code>SourceType = db-instance</code> and <code>SourceIdentifier = myDBInstance1</code>), you are notified of all the <code>db-instance</code> events for the specified source. If you specify a <code>SourceType</code> but do not specify a <code>SourceIdentifier</code>, you receive notice of the events for that source type for all your Amazon DocumentDB sources. If you do not specify either the <code>SourceType</code> or the <code>SourceIdentifier</code>, you are notified of events generated from all Amazon DocumentDB sources belonging to your customer account.

          Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory allows you to configure trust relationships. For example, you can establish a trust between your Managed Microsoft AD directory, and your existing self-managed Microsoft Active Directory. This would allow you to provide users and groups access to resources in either domain, with a single set of credentials. This action initiates the creation of the Amazon Web Services side of a trust relationship between an Managed Microsoft AD directory and an external domain. You can create either a forest trust or an external trust.

With this operation you can use your directory from any Amazon Web Services account and from any Amazon VPC within an Amazon Web Services Region. When you share your Managed Microsoft AD directory, Directory Service creates a shared directory in the directory consumer account. This shared directory contains the metadata to provide access to the directory within the directory owner account. The shared directory is visible in all VPCs in the directory consumer account. The <code>ShareMethod</code> parameter determines whether the specified directory can be shared between Amazon Web Services accounts inside the same Amazon Web Services organization (<code>ORGANIZATIONS</code>). It also determines whether you can share the directory with any other Amazon Web Services account either inside or outside of the organization (<code>HANDSHAKE</code>). The <code>ShareNotes</code> parameter is only used when <code>HANDSHAKE</code> is called, which sends a directory sharing request to the directory consumer.

          The <code>BatchGetItem</code> operation returns the attributes of one or more items from one or more tables. You identify requested items by primary key. A single operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data, which can contain as many as 100 items. <code>BatchGetItem</code> returns a partial result if the response size limit is exceeded, the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded, or an internal processing failure occurs. If a partial result is returned, the operation returns a value for <code>UnprocessedKeys</code>. You can use this value to retry the operation starting with the next item to get. <important> If you request more than 100 items, <code>BatchGetItem</code> returns a <code>ValidationException</code> with the message "Too many items requested for the BatchGetItem call." </important> For example, if you ask to retrieve 100 items, but each individual item is 300 KB in size, the system returns 52 items (so as not to exceed the 16 MB limit). It also returns an appropriate <code>UnprocessedKeys</code> value so you can get the next page of results. If desired, your application can include its own logic to assemble the pages of results into one dataset. If <i>none</i> of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then <code>BatchGetItem</code> returns a <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. If <i>at least one</i> of the items is successfully processed, then <code>BatchGetItem</code> completes successfully, while returning the keys of the unread items in <code>UnprocessedKeys</code>. <important> If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, <i>we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm</i>. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ErrorHandling.html#BatchOperations">Batch Operations and Error Handling</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>. </important> By default, <code>BatchGetItem</code> performs eventually consistent reads on every table in the request. If you want strongly consistent reads instead, you can set <code>ConsistentRead</code> to <code>true</code> for any or all tables. In order to minimize response latency, <code>BatchGetItem</code> retrieves items in parallel. When designing your application, keep in mind that DynamoDB does not return items in any particular order. To help parse the response by item, include the primary key values for the items in your request in the <code>ProjectionExpression</code> parameter. If a requested item does not exist, it is not returned in the result. Requests for nonexistent items consume the minimum read capacity units according to the type of read. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithTables.html#CapacityUnitCalculations">Working with Tables</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.

          The <code>BatchWriteItem</code> operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or more tables. A single call to <code>BatchWriteItem</code> can write up to 16 MB of data, which can comprise as many as 25 put or delete requests. Individual items to be written can be as large as 400 KB. <note> <code>BatchWriteItem</code> cannot update items. To update items, use the <code>UpdateItem</code> action. </note> The individual <code>PutItem</code> and <code>DeleteItem</code> operations specified in <code>BatchWriteItem</code> are atomic; however <code>BatchWriteItem</code> as a whole is not. If any requested operations fail because the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded or an internal processing failure occurs, the failed operations are returned in the <code>UnprocessedItems</code> response parameter. You can investigate and optionally resend the requests. Typically, you would call <code>BatchWriteItem</code> in a loop. Each iteration would check for unprocessed items and submit a new <code>BatchWriteItem</code> request with those unprocessed items until all items have been processed. If <i>none</i> of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then <code>BatchWriteItem</code> returns a <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. <important> If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, <i>we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm</i>. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ErrorHandling.html#Programming.Errors.BatchOperations">Batch Operations and Error Handling</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>. </important> With <code>BatchWriteItem</code>, you can efficiently write or delete large amounts of data, such as from Amazon EMR, or copy data from another database into DynamoDB. In order to improve performance with these large-scale operations, <code>BatchWriteItem</code> does not behave in the same way as individual <code>PutItem</code> and <code>DeleteItem</code> calls would. For example, you cannot specify conditions on individual put and delete requests, and <code>BatchWriteItem</code> does not return deleted items in the response. If you use a programming language that supports concurrency, you can use threads to write items in parallel. Your application must include the necessary logic to manage the threads. With languages that don't support threading, you must update or delete the specified items one at a time. In both situations, <code>BatchWriteItem</code> performs the specified put and delete operations in parallel, giving you the power of the thread pool approach without having to introduce complexity into your application. Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and delete request consumes the same number of write capacity units whether it is processed in parallel or not. Delete operations on nonexistent items consume one write capacity unit. If one or more of the following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire batch write operation: <ul> <li> One or more tables specified in the <code>BatchWriteItem</code> request does not exist. </li> <li> Primary key attributes specified on an item in the request do not match those in the corresponding table's primary key schema. </li> <li> You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in the same <code>BatchWriteItem</code> request. For example, you cannot put and delete the same item in the same <code>BatchWriteItem</code> request. </li> <li> Your request contains at least two items with identical hash and range keys (which essentially is two put operations). </li> <li> There are more than 25 requests in the batch. </li> <li> Any individual item in a batch exceeds 400 KB. </li> <li> The total request size exceeds 16 MB. </li> </ul>

          Creates a backup for an existing table. Each time you create an on-demand backup, the entire table data is backed up. There is no limit to the number of on-demand backups that can be taken. When you create an on-demand backup, a time marker of the request is cataloged, and the backup is created asynchronously, by applying all changes until the time of the request to the last full table snapshot. Backup requests are processed instantaneously and become available for restore within minutes. You can call <code>CreateBackup</code> at a maximum rate of 50 times per second. All backups in DynamoDB work without consuming any provisioned throughput on the table. If you submit a backup request on 2018-12-14 at 14:25:00, the backup is guaranteed to contain all data committed to the table up to 14:24:00, and data committed after 14:26:00 will not be. The backup might contain data modifications made between 14:24:00 and 14:26:00. On-demand backup does not support causal consistency.

DynamoDB strongly recommends enabling auto scaling to manage the write capacity settings for all of your global tables replicas and indexes.

          The <code>CreateTable</code> operation adds a new table to your account. In an AWS account, table names must be unique within each Region. That is, you can have two tables with same name if you create the tables in different Regions. <code>CreateTable</code> is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a <code>CreateTable</code> request, DynamoDB immediately returns a response with a <code>TableStatus</code> of <code>CREATING</code>. After the table is created, DynamoDB sets the <code>TableStatus</code> to <code>ACTIVE</code>. You can perform read and write operations only on an <code>ACTIVE</code> table. You can optionally define secondary indexes on the new table, as part of the <code>CreateTable</code> operation. If you want to create multiple tables with secondary indexes on them, you must create the tables sequentially. Only one table with secondary indexes can be in the <code>CREATING</code> state at any given time. You can use the <code>DescribeTable</code> action to check the table status.

In addition to deleting an item, you can also return the item's attribute values in the same operation, using the <code>ReturnValues</code> parameter. Unless you specify conditions, the <code>DeleteItem</code> is an idempotent operation; running it multiple times on the same item or attribute does <i>not</i> result in an error response.

          Returns the current provisioned-capacity quotas for your AWS account in a Region, both for the Region as a whole and for any one DynamoDB table that you create there. When you establish an AWS account, the account has initial quotas on the maximum read capacity units and write capacity units that you can provision across all of your DynamoDB tables in a given Region. Also, there are per-table quotas that apply when you create a table there. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Limits.html">Service, Account, and Table Quotas</a> page in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>. Although you can increase these quotas by filing a case at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/">AWS Support Center</a>, obtaining the increase is not instantaneous. The <code>DescribeLimits</code> action lets you write code to compare the capacity you are currently using to those quotas imposed by your account so that you have enough time to apply for an increase before you hit a quota. For example, you could use one of the AWS SDKs to do the following: <ol> <li> Call <code>DescribeLimits</code> for a particular Region to obtain your current account quotas on provisioned capacity there. </li> <li> Create a variable to hold the aggregate read capacity units provisioned for all your tables in that Region, and one to hold the aggregate write capacity units. Zero them both. </li> <li> Call <code>ListTables</code> to obtain a list of all your DynamoDB tables. </li> <li> For each table name listed by <code>ListTables</code>, do the following: <ul> <li> Call <code>DescribeTable</code> with the table name. </li> <li> Use the data returned by <code>DescribeTable</code> to add the read capacity units and write capacity units provisioned for the table itself to your variables. </li> <li> If the table has one or more global secondary indexes (GSIs), loop over these GSIs and add their provisioned capacity values to your variables as well. </li> </ul> </li> <li> Report the account quotas for that Region returned by <code>DescribeLimits</code>, along with the total current provisioned capacity levels you have calculated. </li> </ol> This will let you see whether you are getting close to your account-level quotas. The per-table quotas apply only when you are creating a new table. They restrict the sum of the provisioned capacity of the new table itself and all its global secondary indexes. For existing tables and their GSIs, DynamoDB doesn't let you increase provisioned capacity extremely rapidly, but the only quota that applies is that the aggregate provisioned capacity over all your tables and GSIs cannot exceed either of the per-account quotas. <note> <code>DescribeLimits</code> should only be called periodically. You can expect throttling errors if you call it more than once in a minute. </note> The <code>DescribeLimits</code> Request element has no content.

For information on how to call the <code>PutItem</code> API using the AWS SDK in specific languages, see the following: <ul> <li> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/aws-cli/dynamodb-2012-08-10/PutItem"> PutItem in the AWS Command Line Interface</a> </li> <li> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/DotNetSDKV3/dynamodb-2012-08-10/PutItem"> PutItem in the AWS SDK for .NET</a> </li> <li> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/SdkForCpp/dynamodb-2012-08-10/PutItem"> PutItem in the AWS SDK for C++</a> </li> <li> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/SdkForGoV1/dynamodb-2012-08-10/PutItem"> PutItem in the AWS SDK for Go</a> </li> <li> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/SdkForJava/dynamodb-2012-08-10/PutItem"> PutItem in the AWS SDK for Java</a> </li> <li> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/AWSJavaScriptSDK/dynamodb-2012-08-10/PutItem"> PutItem in the AWS SDK for JavaScript</a> </li> <li> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/SdkForPHPV3/dynamodb-2012-08-10/PutItem"> PutItem in the AWS SDK for PHP V3</a> </li> <li> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/boto3/dynamodb-2012-08-10/PutItem"> PutItem in the AWS SDK for Python</a> </li> <li> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/SdkForRubyV2/dynamodb-2012-08-10/PutItem"> PutItem in the AWS SDK for Ruby V2</a> </li> </ul> </important> When you add an item, the primary key attributes are the only required attributes. Attribute values cannot be null. Empty String and Binary attribute values are allowed. Attribute values of type String and Binary must have a length greater than zero if the attribute is used as a key attribute for a table or index. Set type attributes cannot be empty. Invalid Requests with empty values will be rejected with a <code>ValidationException</code> exception. <note> To prevent a new item from replacing an existing item, use a conditional expression that contains the <code>attribute_not_exists</code> function with the name of the attribute being used as the partition key for the table. Since every record must contain that attribute, the <code>attribute_not_exists</code> function will only succeed if no matching item exists. </note> For more information about <code>PutItem</code>, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithItems.html">Working with Items</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>.

          The <code>Query</code> operation finds items based on primary key values. You can query any table or secondary index that has a composite primary key (a partition key and a sort key). Use the <code>KeyConditionExpression</code> parameter to provide a specific value for the partition key. The <code>Query</code> operation will return all of the items from the table or index with that partition key value. You can optionally narrow the scope of the <code>Query</code> operation by specifying a sort key value and a comparison operator in <code>KeyConditionExpression</code>. To further refine the <code>Query</code> results, you can optionally provide a <code>FilterExpression</code>. A <code>FilterExpression</code> determines which items within the results should be returned to you. All of the other results are discarded. A <code>Query</code> operation always returns a result set. If no matching items are found, the result set will be empty. Queries that do not return results consume the minimum number of read capacity units for that type of read operation. <note> DynamoDB calculates the number of read capacity units consumed based on item size, not on the amount of data that is returned to an application. The number of capacity units consumed will be the same whether you request all of the attributes (the default behavior) or just some of them (using a projection expression). The number will also be the same whether or not you use a <code>FilterExpression</code>. </note> <code>Query</code> results are always sorted by the sort key value. If the data type of the sort key is Number, the results are returned in numeric order; otherwise, the results are returned in order of UTF-8 bytes. By default, the sort order is ascending. To reverse the order, set the <code>ScanIndexForward</code> parameter to false. A single <code>Query</code> operation will read up to the maximum number of items set (if using the <code>Limit</code> parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data and then apply any filtering to the results using <code>FilterExpression</code>. If <code>LastEvaluatedKey</code> is present in the response, you will need to paginate the result set. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Query.html#Query.Pagination">Paginating the Results</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>. <code>FilterExpression</code> is applied after a <code>Query</code> finishes, but before the results are returned. A <code>FilterExpression</code> cannot contain partition key or sort key attributes. You need to specify those attributes in the <code>KeyConditionExpression</code>. <note> A <code>Query</code> operation can return an empty result set and a <code>LastEvaluatedKey</code> if all the items read for the page of results are filtered out. </note> You can query a table, a local secondary index, or a global secondary index. For a query on a table or on a local secondary index, you can set the <code>ConsistentRead</code> parameter to <code>true</code> and obtain a strongly consistent result. Global secondary indexes support eventually consistent reads only, so do not specify <code>ConsistentRead</code> when querying a global secondary index.

          The <code>Scan</code> operation returns one or more items and item attributes by accessing every item in a table or a secondary index. To have DynamoDB return fewer items, you can provide a <code>FilterExpression</code> operation. If the total number of scanned items exceeds the maximum dataset size limit of 1 MB, the scan stops and results are returned to the user as a <code>LastEvaluatedKey</code> value to continue the scan in a subsequent operation. The results also include the number of items exceeding the limit. A scan can result in no table data meeting the filter criteria. A single <code>Scan</code> operation reads up to the maximum number of items set (if using the <code>Limit</code> parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data and then apply any filtering to the results using <code>FilterExpression</code>. If <code>LastEvaluatedKey</code> is present in the response, you need to paginate the result set. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Scan.html#Scan.Pagination">Paginating the Results</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>. <code>Scan</code> operations proceed sequentially; however, for faster performance on a large table or secondary index, applications can request a parallel <code>Scan</code> operation by providing the <code>Segment</code> and <code>TotalSegments</code> parameters. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Scan.html#Scan.ParallelScan">Parallel Scan</a> in the <i>Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide</i>. <code>Scan</code> uses eventually consistent reads when accessing the data in a table; therefore, the result set might not include the changes to data in the table immediately before the operation began. If you need a consistent copy of the data, as of the time that the <code>Scan</code> begins, you can set the <code>ConsistentRead</code> parameter to <code>true</code>.

However, you can create your own cluster with a unique name with the <code>CreateCluster</code> action. <note> When you call the <a>CreateCluster</a> API operation, Amazon ECS attempts to create the Amazon ECS service-linked role for your account so that required resources in other Amazon Web Services services can be managed on your behalf. However, if the IAM user that makes the call does not have permissions to create the service-linked role, it is not created. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html">Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon ECS</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>. </note>

          Runs and maintains a desired number of tasks from a specified task definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below the <code>desiredCount</code>, Amazon ECS runs another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see the UpdateService action. In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind one or more load balancers. The load balancers distribute traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html">Service Load Balancing</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>. Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and the container instance that they're hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer. There are two service scheduler strategies available: <ul> <li> <code>REPLICA</code> - The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html">Service Scheduler Concepts</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>. </li> <li> <code>DAEMON</code> - The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that do not meet the placement constraints. When using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html">Service Scheduler Concepts</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>. </li> </ul> You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. The deployment is triggered by changing properties, such as the task definition or the desired count of a service, with an <a>UpdateService</a> operation. The default value for a replica service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 100%. The default value for a daemon service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 0%. If a service is using the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller, the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the <code>RUNNING</code> state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler might stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and they're reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%. If a service is using the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller, the <b>maximum percent</b> parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the <code>RUNNING</code> or <code>PENDING</code> state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for maximum percent is 200%. If a service is using either the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> or <code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the <b>minimum healthy percent</b> and <b>maximum percent</b> values are used only to define the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the <code>RUNNING</code> state while the container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values aren't used, although they're currently visible when describing your service. When creating a service that uses the <code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller, you can specify only parameters that aren't controlled at the task set level. The only required parameter is the service name. You control your services using the <a>CreateTaskSet</a> operation. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-types.html">Amazon ECS Deployment Types</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>. When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster using the following logic: <ul> <li> Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes). </li> <li> By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy) with the <code>placementStrategy</code> parameter): <ul> <li> Sort the valid container instances, giving priority to instances that have the fewest number of running tasks for this service in their respective Availability Zone. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement. </li> <li> Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service. </li> </ul> </li> </ul>

          Starts a new task using the specified task definition. You can allow Amazon ECS to place tasks for you, or you can customize how Amazon ECS places tasks using placement constraints and placement strategies. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/scheduling_tasks.html">Scheduling Tasks</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>. Alternatively, you can use <a>StartTask</a> to use your own scheduler or place tasks manually on specific container instances. The Amazon ECS API follows an eventual consistency model, due to the distributed nature of the system supporting the API. This means that the result of an API command you run that affects your Amazon ECS resources might not be immediately visible to all subsequent commands you run. Keep this in mind when you carry out an API command that immediately follows a previous API command. To manage eventual consistency, you can do the following: <ul> <li> Confirm the state of the resource before you run a command to modify it. Run the DescribeTasks command using an exponential backoff algorithm to ensure that you allow enough time for the previous command to propagate through the system. To do this, run the DescribeTasks command repeatedly, starting with a couple of seconds of wait time and increasing gradually up to five minutes of wait time. </li> <li> Add wait time between subsequent commands, even if the DescribeTasks command returns an accurate response. Apply an exponential backoff algorithm starting with a couple of seconds of wait time, and increase gradually up to about five minutes of wait time. </li> </ul>

          Modifies the status of an Amazon ECS container instance. Once a container instance has reached an <code>ACTIVE</code> state, you can change the status of a container instance to <code>DRAINING</code> to manually remove an instance from a cluster, for example to perform system updates, update the Docker daemon, or scale down the cluster size. <important> A container instance cannot be changed to <code>DRAINING</code> until it has reached an <code>ACTIVE</code> status. If the instance is in any other status, an error will be received. </important> When you set a container instance to <code>DRAINING</code>, Amazon ECS prevents new tasks from being scheduled for placement on the container instance and replacement service tasks are started on other container instances in the cluster if the resources are available. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the <code>PENDING</code> state are stopped immediately. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state are stopped and replaced according to the service's deployment configuration parameters, <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> and <code>maximumPercent</code>. You can change the deployment configuration of your service using <a>UpdateService</a>. <ul> <li> If <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore <code>desiredCount</code> temporarily during task replacement. For example, <code>desiredCount</code> is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. If the minimum is 100%, the service scheduler can't remove existing tasks until the replacement tasks are considered healthy. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer. </li> <li> The <code>maximumPercent</code> parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during task replacement, which enables you to define the replacement batch size. For example, if <code>desiredCount</code> is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four tasks to be drained, provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available. If the maximum is 100%, then replacement tasks can't start until the draining tasks have stopped. </li> </ul> Any <code>PENDING</code> or <code>RUNNING</code> tasks that do not belong to a service are not affected. You must wait for them to finish or stop them manually. A container instance has completed draining when it has no more <code>RUNNING</code> tasks. You can verify this using <a>ListTasks</a>. When a container instance has been drained, you can set a container instance to <code>ACTIVE</code> status and once it has reached that status the Amazon ECS scheduler can begin scheduling tasks on the instance again.

          <important> Updating the task placement strategies and constraints on an Amazon ECS service remains in preview and is a Beta Service as defined by and subject to the Beta Service Participation Service Terms located at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms">https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms</a> ("Beta Terms"). These Beta Terms apply to your participation in this preview. </important> Modifies the parameters of a service. For services using the rolling update (<code>ECS</code>) deployment controller, the desired count, deployment configuration, network configuration, task placement constraints and strategies, or task definition used can be updated. For services using the blue/green (<code>CODE_DEPLOY</code>) deployment controller, only the desired count, deployment configuration, task placement constraints and strategies, and health check grace period can be updated using this API. If the network configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be updated, a new CodeDeploy deployment should be created. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDeployment.html">CreateDeployment</a> in the <i>CodeDeploy API Reference</i>. For services using an external deployment controller, you can update only the desired count, task placement constraints and strategies, and health check grace period using this API. If the launch type, load balancer, network configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be updated, you should create a new task set. For more information, see <a>CreateTaskSet</a>. You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task definition in a service by specifying the cluster that the service is running in and a new <code>desiredCount</code> parameter. If you have updated the Docker image of your application, you can create a new task definition with that image and deploy it to your service. The service scheduler uses the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent parameters (in the service's deployment configuration) to determine the deployment strategy. <note> If your updated Docker image uses the same tag as what is in the existing task definition for your service (for example, <code>my_image:latest</code>), you do not need to create a new revision of your task definition. You can update the service using the <code>forceNewDeployment</code> option. The new tasks launched by the deployment pull the current image/tag combination from your repository when they start. </note> You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of a service, the service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters, <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> and <code>maximumPercent</code>, to determine the deployment strategy. <ul> <li> If <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore <code>desiredCount</code> temporarily during a deployment. For example, if <code>desiredCount</code> is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer. </li> <li> The <code>maximumPercent</code> parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during a deployment, which enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if <code>desiredCount</code> is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). </li> </ul> When <a>UpdateService</a> stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of <code>docker stop</code> is issued to the containers running in the task. This results in a <code>SIGTERM</code> and a 30-second timeout, after which <code>SIGKILL</code> is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the <code>SIGTERM</code> gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no <code>SIGKILL</code> is sent. When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster with the following logic: <ul> <li> Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes). </li> <li> By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy): <ul> <li> Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement. </li> <li> Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> When the service scheduler stops running tasks, it attempts to maintain balance across the Availability Zones in your cluster using the following logic: <ul> <li> Sort the container instances by the largest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have two, container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for termination. </li> <li> Stop the task on a container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the largest number of running tasks for this service. </li> </ul>

          Creates an Amazon EKS control plane. The Amazon EKS control plane consists of control plane instances that run the Kubernetes software, such as <code>etcd</code> and the API server. The control plane runs in an account managed by Amazon Web Services, and the Kubernetes API is exposed via the Amazon EKS API server endpoint. Each Amazon EKS cluster control plane is single-tenant and unique and runs on its own set of Amazon EC2 instances. The cluster control plane is provisioned across multiple Availability Zones and fronted by an Elastic Load Balancing Network Load Balancer. Amazon EKS also provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC subnets to provide connectivity from the control plane instances to the nodes (for example, to support <code>kubectl exec</code>, <code>logs</code>, and <code>proxy</code> data flows). Amazon EKS nodes run in your Amazon Web Services account and connect to your cluster's control plane via the Kubernetes API server endpoint and a certificate file that is created for your cluster. Cluster creation typically takes several minutes. After you create an Amazon EKS cluster, you must configure your Kubernetes tooling to communicate with the API server and launch nodes into your cluster.

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Creates an Fargate profile for your Amazon EKS cluster. You must have at least one Fargate profile in a cluster to be able to run pods on Fargate. The Fargate profile allows an administrator to declare which pods run on Fargate and specify which pods run on which Fargate profile. This declaration is done through the profileâ€™s selectors. Each profile can have up to five selectors that contain a namespace and labels. A namespace is required for every selector. The label field consists of multiple optional key-value pairs. Pods that match the selectors are scheduled on Fargate. If a to-be-scheduled pod matches any of the selectors in the Fargate profile, then that pod is run on Fargate. When you create a Fargate profile, you must specify a pod execution role to use with the pods that are scheduled with the profile. This role is added to the cluster's Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/">Role Based Access Control</a> (RBAC) for authorization so that the <code>kubelet</code> that is running on the Fargate infrastructure can register with your Amazon EKS cluster so that it can appear in your cluster as a node. The pod execution role also provides IAM permissions to the Fargate infrastructure to allow read access to Amazon ECR image repositories. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-execution-role.html">Pod Execution Role</a> in the <i>Amazon EKS User Guide</i>. Fargate profiles are immutable. However, you can create a new updated profile to replace an existing profile and then delete the original after the updated profile has finished creating. If any Fargate profiles in a cluster are in the <code>DELETING</code> status, you must wait for that Fargate profile to finish deleting before you can create any other profiles in that cluster.

Second, a <a href="https://amazon-eks.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/eks-connector/manifests/eks-connector/latest/eks-connector.yaml">Manifest</a> containing the <code>activationID</code> and <code>activationCode</code> must be applied to the Kubernetes cluster through it's native provider to provide visibility. After the Manifest is updated and applied, then the connected cluster is visible to the Amazon EKS control plane. If the Manifest is not applied within a set amount of time, then the connected cluster will no longer be visible and must be deregistered. See <a>DeregisterCluster</a>.

          A tag is a key-value pair where the key and value are case-sensitive. You can use tags to categorize and track all your ElastiCache resources, with the exception of global replication group. When you add or remove tags on replication groups, those actions will be replicated to all nodes in the replication group. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/IAM.ResourceLevelPermissions.html">Resource-level permissions</a>. For example, you can use cost-allocation tags to your ElastiCache resources, Amazon generates a cost allocation report as a comma-separated value (CSV) file with your usage and costs aggregated by your tags. You can apply tags that represent business categories (such as cost centers, application names, or owners) to organize your costs across multiple services. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/Tagging.html">Using Cost Allocation Tags in Amazon ElastiCache</a> in the <i>ElastiCache User Guide</i>.

          Creates a Redis (cluster mode disabled) or a Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication group. This API can be used to create a standalone regional replication group or a secondary replication group associated with a Global datastore. A Redis (cluster mode disabled) replication group is a collection of clusters, where one of the clusters is a read/write primary and the others are read-only replicas. Writes to the primary are asynchronously propagated to the replicas. A Redis cluster-mode enabled cluster is comprised of from 1 to 90 shards (API/CLI: node groups). Each shard has a primary node and up to 5 read-only replica nodes. The configuration can range from 90 shards and 0 replicas to 15 shards and 5 replicas, which is the maximum number or replicas allowed. The node or shard limit can be increased to a maximum of 500 per cluster if the Redis engine version is 5.0.6 or higher. For example, you can choose to configure a 500 node cluster that ranges between 83 shards (one primary and 5 replicas per shard) and 500 shards (single primary and no replicas). Make sure there are enough available IP addresses to accommodate the increase. Common pitfalls include the subnets in the subnet group have too small a CIDR range or the subnets are shared and heavily used by other clusters. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/SubnetGroups.Creating.html">Creating a Subnet Group</a>. For versions below 5.0.6, the limit is 250 per cluster. To request a limit increase, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html">Amazon Service Limits</a> and choose the limit type <b>Nodes per cluster per instance type</b>. When a Redis (cluster mode disabled) replication group has been successfully created, you can add one or more read replicas to it, up to a total of 5 read replicas. If you need to increase or decrease the number of node groups (console: shards), you can avail yourself of ElastiCache for Redis' scaling. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/Scaling.html">Scaling ElastiCache for Redis Clusters</a> in the <i>ElastiCache User Guide</i>. <note> This operation is valid for Redis only. </note>

By default, abbreviated information about the clusters is returned. You can use the optional <i>ShowCacheNodeInfo</i> flag to retrieve detailed information about the cache nodes associated with the clusters. These details include the DNS address and port for the cache node endpoint. If the cluster is in the <i>creating</i> state, only cluster-level information is displayed until all of the nodes are successfully provisioned. If the cluster is in the <i>deleting</i> state, only cluster-level information is displayed. If cache nodes are currently being added to the cluster, node endpoint information and creation time for the additional nodes are not displayed until they are completely provisioned. When the cluster state is <i>available</i>, the cluster is ready for use. If cache nodes are currently being removed from the cluster, no endpoint information for the removed nodes is displayed.

Specify a source bundle in S3 with <code>SourceBundle</code> Omit both <code>SourceBuildInformation</code> and <code>SourceBundle</code> to use the default sample application. <note> After you create an application version with a specified Amazon S3 bucket and key location, you can't change that Amazon S3 location. If you change the Amazon S3 location, you receive an exception when you attempt to launch an environment from the application version. </note>

          Creates an AWS Elastic Beanstalk configuration template, associated with a specific Elastic Beanstalk application. You define application configuration settings in a configuration template. You can then use the configuration template to deploy different versions of the application with the same configuration settings. Templates aren't associated with any environment. The <code>EnvironmentName</code> response element is always <code>null</code>.

          The CreatePreset operation creates a preset with settings that you specify. <important> Elastic Transcoder checks the CreatePreset settings to ensure that they meet Elastic Transcoder requirements and to determine whether they comply with H.264 standards. If your settings are not valid for Elastic Transcoder, Elastic Transcoder returns an HTTP 400 response (<code>ValidationException</code>) and does not create the preset. If the settings are valid for Elastic Transcoder but aren't strictly compliant with the H.264 standard, Elastic Transcoder creates the preset and returns a warning message in the response. This helps you determine whether your settings comply with the H.264 standard while giving you greater flexibility with respect to the video that Elastic Transcoder produces. </important> Elastic Transcoder uses the H.264 video-compression format.

          Generates a stickiness policy with sticky session lifetimes that follow that of an application-generated cookie. This policy can be associated only with HTTP/HTTPS listeners. This policy is similar to the policy created by <a>CreateLBCookieStickinessPolicy</a>, except that the lifetime of the special Elastic Load Balancing cookie, <code>AWSELB</code>, follows the lifetime of the application-generated cookie specified in the policy configuration. The load balancer only inserts a new stickiness cookie when the application response includes a new application cookie. If the application cookie is explicitly removed or expires, the session stops being sticky until a new application cookie is issued.

          Generates a stickiness policy with sticky session lifetimes controlled by the lifetime of the browser (user-agent) or a specified expiration period. This policy can be associated only with HTTP/HTTPS listeners. When a load balancer implements this policy, the load balancer uses a special cookie to track the instance for each request. When the load balancer receives a request, it first checks to see if this cookie is present in the request. If so, the load balancer sends the request to the application server specified in the cookie. If not, the load balancer sends the request to a server that is chosen based on the existing load-balancing algorithm. A cookie is inserted into the response for binding subsequent requests from the same user to that server. The validity of the cookie is based on the cookie expiration time, which is specified in the policy configuration.

If you have EC2-Classic instances and a load balancer in a VPC with ClassicLink enabled, you can link the EC2-Classic instances to that VPC and then register the linked EC2-Classic instances with the load balancer in the VPC. Note that <code>RegisterInstanceWithLoadBalancer</code> completes when the request has been registered. Instance registration takes a little time to complete. To check the state of the registered instances, use <a>DescribeLoadBalancers</a> or <a>DescribeInstanceHealth</a>. After the instance is registered, it starts receiving traffic and requests from the load balancer. Any instance that is not in one of the Availability Zones registered for the load balancer is moved to the <code>OutOfService</code> state. If an Availability Zone is added to the load balancer later, any instances registered with the load balancer move to the <code>InService</code> state. To deregister instances from a load balancer, use <a>DeregisterInstancesFromLoadBalancer</a>.

By default, the load balancer routes requests to registered targets using the protocol and port for the target group. Alternatively, you can override the port for a target when you register it. You can register each EC2 instance or IP address with the same target group multiple times using different ports. With a Network Load Balancer, you cannot register instances by instance ID if they have the following instance types: C1, CC1, CC2, CG1, CG2, CR1, CS1, G1, G2, HI1, HS1, M1, M2, M3, and T1.

          Assigns tags to resources. A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. Tags enable you to categorize your AWS resources by attributes such as purpose, owner, or environment. When you have many resources of the same type, you can quickly identify a specific resource based on the tags you've assigned to it. For example, you can define a set of tags for your Amazon EMR on EKS clusters to help you track each cluster's owner and stack level. We recommend that you devise a consistent set of tag keys for each resource type. You can then search and filter the resources based on the tags that you add.

          AddJobFlowSteps adds new steps to a running cluster. A maximum of 256 steps are allowed in each job flow. If your cluster is long-running (such as a Hive data warehouse) or complex, you may require more than 256 steps to process your data. You can bypass the 256-step limitation in various ways, including using SSH to connect to the master node and submitting queries directly to the software running on the master node, such as Hive and Hadoop. For more information on how to do this, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/AddMoreThan256Steps.html">Add More than 256 Steps to a Cluster</a> in the <i>Amazon EMR Management Guide</i>. A step specifies the location of a JAR file stored either on the master node of the cluster or in Amazon S3. Each step is performed by the main function of the main class of the JAR file. The main class can be specified either in the manifest of the JAR or by using the MainFunction parameter of the step. Amazon EMR executes each step in the order listed. For a step to be considered complete, the main function must exit with a zero exit code and all Hadoop jobs started while the step was running must have completed and run successfully. You can only add steps to a cluster that is in one of the following states: STARTING, BOOTSTRAPPING, RUNNING, or WAITING.

A maximum of 256 steps are allowed in each CancelSteps request. CancelSteps is idempotent but asynchronous; it does not guarantee that a step will be canceled, even if the request is successfully submitted. When you use Amazon EMR versions 5.28.0 and later, you can cancel steps that are in a <code>PENDING</code> or <code>RUNNING</code> state. In earlier versions of Amazon EMR, you can only cancel steps that are in a <code>PENDING</code> state.

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          RunJobFlow creates and starts running a new cluster (job flow). The cluster runs the steps specified. After the steps complete, the cluster stops and the HDFS partition is lost. To prevent loss of data, configure the last step of the job flow to store results in Amazon S3. If the <a>JobFlowInstancesConfig</a> <code>KeepJobFlowAliveWhenNoSteps</code> parameter is set to <code>TRUE</code>, the cluster transitions to the WAITING state rather than shutting down after the steps have completed. For additional protection, you can set the <a>JobFlowInstancesConfig</a> <code>TerminationProtected</code> parameter to <code>TRUE</code> to lock the cluster and prevent it from being terminated by API call, user intervention, or in the event of a job flow error. A maximum of 256 steps are allowed in each job flow. If your cluster is long-running (such as a Hive data warehouse) or complex, you may require more than 256 steps to process your data. You can bypass the 256-step limitation in various ways, including using the SSH shell to connect to the master node and submitting queries directly to the software running on the master node, such as Hive and Hadoop. For more information on how to do this, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/AddMoreThan256Steps.html">Add More than 256 Steps to a Cluster</a> in the <i>Amazon EMR Management Guide</i>. For long running clusters, we recommend that you periodically store your results. <note> The instance fleets configuration is available only in Amazon EMR versions 4.8.0 and later, excluding 5.0.x versions. The RunJobFlow request can contain InstanceFleets parameters or InstanceGroups parameters, but not both. </note>

          Called by an SaaS partner to create a partner event source. This operation is not used by Amazon Web Services customers. Each partner event source can be used by one Amazon Web Services account to create a matching partner event bus in that Amazon Web Services account. A SaaS partner must create one partner event source for each Amazon Web Services account that wants to receive those event types. A partner event source creates events based on resources within the SaaS partner's service or application. An Amazon Web Services account that creates a partner event bus that matches the partner event source can use that event bus to receive events from the partner, and then process them using Amazon Web Services Events rules and targets. Partner event source names follow this format: <code> <i>partner_name</i>/<i>event_namespace</i>/<i>event_name</i> </code> <i>partner_name</i> is determined during partner registration and identifies the partner to Amazon Web Services customers. <i>event_namespace</i> is determined by the partner and is a way for the partner to categorize their events. <i>event_name</i> is determined by the partner, and should uniquely identify an event-generating resource within the partner system. The combination of <i>event_namespace</i> and <i>event_name</i> should help Amazon Web Services customers decide whether to create an event bus to receive these events.

A replay processes events to replay based on the time in the event, and replays them using 1 minute intervals. If you use <code>StartReplay</code> and specify an <code>EventStartTime</code> and an <code>EventEndTime</code> that covers a 20 minute time range, the events are replayed from the first minute of that 20 minute range first. Then the events from the second minute are replayed. You can use <code>DescribeReplay</code> to determine the progress of a replay. The value returned for <code>EventLastReplayedTime</code> indicates the time within the specified time range associated with the last event replayed.

          Creates or updates the specified rule. Rules are enabled by default, or based on value of the state. You can disable a rule using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_DisableRule.html">DisableRule</a>. A single rule watches for events from a single event bus. Events generated by Amazon Web Services services go to your account's default event bus. Events generated by SaaS partner services or applications go to the matching partner event bus. If you have custom applications or services, you can specify whether their events go to your default event bus or a custom event bus that you have created. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEventBus.html">CreateEventBus</a>. If you are updating an existing rule, the rule is replaced with what you specify in this <code>PutRule</code> command. If you omit arguments in <code>PutRule</code>, the old values for those arguments are not kept. Instead, they are replaced with null values. When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not immediately start matching to new or updated rules. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect. A rule must contain at least an EventPattern or ScheduleExpression. Rules with EventPatterns are triggered when a matching event is observed. Rules with ScheduleExpressions self-trigger based on the given schedule. A rule can have both an EventPattern and a ScheduleExpression, in which case the rule triggers on matching events as well as on a schedule. When you initially create a rule, you can optionally assign one or more tags to the rule. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only rules with certain tag values. To use the <code>PutRule</code> operation and assign tags, you must have both the <code>events:PutRule</code> and <code>events:TagResource</code> permissions. If you are updating an existing rule, any tags you specify in the <code>PutRule</code> operation are ignored. To update the tags of an existing rule, use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html">TagResource</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_UntagResource.html">UntagResource</a>. Most services in Amazon Web Services treat : or / as the same character in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). However, EventBridge uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you want to match. In EventBridge, it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to change them to the desired state. If the rule is not written carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again, creating an infinite loop. To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not re-fire the same rule. For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change. An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend that you use budgeting, which alerts you when charges exceed your specified limit. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/budgets-managing-costs.html">Managing Your Costs with Budgets</a>.

          Adds the specified targets to the specified rule, or updates the targets if they are already associated with the rule. Targets are the resources that are invoked when a rule is triggered. You can configure the following as targets for Events: <ul> <li> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-api-destinations.html">API destination</a> </li> <li> Amazon API Gateway REST API endpoints </li> <li> API Gateway </li> <li> Batch job queue </li> <li> CloudWatch Logs group </li> <li> CodeBuild project </li> <li> CodePipeline </li> <li> Amazon EC2 <code>CreateSnapshot</code> API call </li> <li> Amazon EC2 <code>RebootInstances</code> API call </li> <li> Amazon EC2 <code>StopInstances</code> API call </li> <li> Amazon EC2 <code>TerminateInstances</code> API call </li> <li> Amazon ECS tasks </li> <li> Event bus in a different Amazon Web Services account or Region. You can use an event bus in the US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1, US West (Oregon) us-west-2, or Europe (Ireland) eu-west-1 Regions as a target for a rule. </li> <li> Firehose delivery stream (Kinesis Data Firehose) </li> <li> Inspector assessment template (Amazon Inspector) </li> <li> Kinesis stream (Kinesis Data Stream) </li> <li> Lambda function </li> <li> Redshift clusters (Data API statement execution) </li> <li> Amazon SNS topic </li> <li> Amazon SQS queues (includes FIFO queues </li> <li> SSM Automation </li> <li> SSM OpsItem </li> <li> SSM Run Command </li> <li> Step Functions state machines </li> </ul> Creating rules with built-in targets is supported only in the Amazon Web Services Management Console. The built-in targets are <code>EC2 CreateSnapshot API call</code>, <code>EC2 RebootInstances API call</code>, <code>EC2 StopInstances API call</code>, and <code>EC2 TerminateInstances API call</code>. For some target types, <code>PutTargets</code> provides target-specific parameters. If the target is a Kinesis data stream, you can optionally specify which shard the event goes to by using the <code>KinesisParameters</code> argument. To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the <code>RunCommandParameters</code> field. To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon EventBridge needs the appropriate permissions. For Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, EventBridge relies on resource-based policies. For EC2 instances, Kinesis Data Streams, Step Functions state machines and API Gateway REST APIs, EventBridge relies on IAM roles that you specify in the <code>RoleARN</code> argument in <code>PutTargets</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-eventbridge.html">Authentication and Access Control</a> in the <i>Amazon EventBridge User Guide</i>. If another Amazon Web Services account is in the same region and has granted you permission (using <code>PutPermission</code>), you can send events to that account. Set that account's event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To send the matched events to the other account, specify that account's event bus as the <code>Arn</code> value when you run <code>PutTargets</code>. If your account sends events to another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to another account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event is not charged. For more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/pricing/">Amazon EventBridge Pricing</a>. <note> <code>Input</code>, <code>InputPath</code>, and <code>InputTransformer</code> are not available with <code>PutTarget</code> if the target is an event bus of a different Amazon Web Services account. </note> If you are setting the event bus of another account as the target, and that account granted permission to your account through an organization instead of directly by the account ID, then you must specify a <code>RoleArn</code> with proper permissions in the <code>Target</code> structure. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-cross-account-event-delivery.html">Sending and Receiving Events Between Amazon Web Services Accounts</a> in the <i>Amazon EventBridge User Guide</i>. For more information about enabling cross-account events, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_PutPermission.html">PutPermission</a>. <b>Input</b>, <b>InputPath</b>, and <b>InputTransformer</b> are mutually exclusive and optional parameters of a target. When a rule is triggered due to a matched event: <ul> <li> If none of the following arguments are specified for a target, then the entire event is passed to the target in JSON format (unless the target is Amazon EC2 Run Command or Amazon ECS task, in which case nothing from the event is passed to the target). </li> <li> If <b>Input</b> is specified in the form of valid JSON, then the matched event is overridden with this constant. </li> <li> If <b>InputPath</b> is specified in the form of JSONPath (for example, <code>$.detail</code>), then only the part of the event specified in the path is passed to the target (for example, only the detail part of the event is passed). </li> <li> If <b>InputTransformer</b> is specified, then one or more specified JSONPaths are extracted from the event and used as values in a template that you specify as the input to the target. </li> </ul> When you specify <code>InputPath</code> or <code>InputTransformer</code>, you must use JSON dot notation, not bracket notation.

This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the same time. If that happens, <code>FailedEntryCount</code> is non-zero in the response and each entry in <code>FailedEntries</code> provides the ID of the failed target and the error code.

A replay processes events to replay based on the time in the event, and replays them using 1 minute intervals. If you specify an <code>EventStartTime</code> and an <code>EventEndTime</code> that covers a 20 minute time range, the events are replayed from the first minute of that 20 minute range first. Then the events from the second minute are replayed. You can use <code>DescribeReplay</code> to determine the progress of a replay. The value returned for <code>EventLastReplayedTime</code> indicates the time within the specified time range associated with the last event replayed.

          Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified EventBridge resource. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. In EventBridge, rules and event buses can be tagged. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters. You can use the <code>TagResource</code> action with a resource that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the resource. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the resource, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag. You can associate as many as 50 tags with a resource.

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Creates a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. By default, you can create up to 50 delivery streams per AWS Region. This is an asynchronous operation that immediately returns. The initial status of the delivery stream is <code>CREATING</code>. After the delivery stream is created, its status is <code>ACTIVE</code> and it now accepts data. If the delivery stream creation fails, the status transitions to <code>CREATING_FAILED</code>. Attempts to send data to a delivery stream that is not in the <code>ACTIVE</code> state cause an exception. To check the state of a delivery stream, use <a>DescribeDeliveryStream</a>. If the status of a delivery stream is <code>CREATING_FAILED</code>, this status doesn't change, and you can't invoke <code>CreateDeliveryStream</code> again on it. However, you can invoke the <a>DeleteDeliveryStream</a> operation to delete it. A Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream can be configured to receive records directly from providers using <a>PutRecord</a> or <a>PutRecordBatch</a>, or it can be configured to use an existing Kinesis stream as its source. To specify a Kinesis data stream as input, set the <code>DeliveryStreamType</code> parameter to <code>KinesisStreamAsSource</code>, and provide the Kinesis stream Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and role ARN in the <code>KinesisStreamSourceConfiguration</code> parameter. To create a delivery stream with server-side encryption (SSE) enabled, include <a>DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfigurationInput</a> in your request. This is optional. You can also invoke <a>StartDeliveryStreamEncryption</a> to turn on SSE for an existing delivery stream that doesn't have SSE enabled. A delivery stream is configured with a single destination: Amazon S3, Amazon ES, Amazon Redshift, or Splunk. You must specify only one of the following destination configuration parameters: <code>ExtendedS3DestinationConfiguration</code>, <code>S3DestinationConfiguration</code>, <code>ElasticsearchDestinationConfiguration</code>, <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration</code>, or <code>SplunkDestinationConfiguration</code>. When you specify <code>S3DestinationConfiguration</code>, you can also provide the following optional values: BufferingHints, <code>EncryptionConfiguration</code>, and <code>CompressionFormat</code>. By default, if no <code>BufferingHints</code> value is provided, Kinesis Data Firehose buffers data up to 5 MB or for 5 minutes, whichever condition is satisfied first. <code>BufferingHints</code> is a hint, so there are some cases where the service cannot adhere to these conditions strictly. For example, record boundaries might be such that the size is a little over or under the configured buffering size. By default, no encryption is performed. We strongly recommend that you enable encryption to ensure secure data storage in Amazon S3. A few notes about Amazon Redshift as a destination: <ul> <li> An Amazon Redshift destination requires an S3 bucket as intermediate location. Kinesis Data Firehose first delivers data to Amazon S3 and then uses <code>COPY</code> syntax to load data into an Amazon Redshift table. This is specified in the <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration</code> parameter. </li> <li> The compression formats <code>SNAPPY</code> or <code>ZIP</code> cannot be specified in <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration</code> because the Amazon Redshift <code>COPY</code> operation that reads from the S3 bucket doesn't support these compression formats. </li> <li> We strongly recommend that you use the user name and password you provide exclusively with Kinesis Data Firehose, and that the permissions for the account are restricted for Amazon Redshift <code>INSERT</code> permissions. </li> </ul> Kinesis Data Firehose assumes the IAM role that is configured as part of the destination. The role should allow the Kinesis Data Firehose principal to assume the role, and the role should have permissions that allow the service to deliver the data. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/controlling-access.html#using-iam-s3">Grant Kinesis Data Firehose Access to an Amazon S3 Destination</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Developer Guide</i>.

          Deletes a delivery stream and its data. To check the state of a delivery stream, use <a>DescribeDeliveryStream</a>. You can delete a delivery stream only if it is in one of the following states: <code>ACTIVE</code>, <code>DELETING</code>, <code>CREATING_FAILED</code>, or <code>DELETING_FAILED</code>. You can't delete a delivery stream that is in the <code>CREATING</code> state. While the deletion request is in process, the delivery stream is in the <code>DELETING</code> state. While the delivery stream is in the <code>DELETING</code> state, the service might continue to accept records, but it doesn't make any guarantees with respect to delivering the data. Therefore, as a best practice, first stop any applications that are sending records before you delete a delivery stream.

Applications using these operations are referred to as producers. By default, each delivery stream can take in up to 2,000 transactions per second, 5,000 records per second, or 5 MB per second. If you use <a>PutRecord</a> and <a>PutRecordBatch</a>, the limits are an aggregate across these two operations for each delivery stream. For more information about limits and how to request an increase, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/limits.html">Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Limits</a>. You must specify the name of the delivery stream and the data record when using <a>PutRecord</a>. The data record consists of a data blob that can be up to 1,000 KiB in size, and any kind of data. For example, it can be a segment from a log file, geographic location data, website clickstream data, and so on. Kinesis Data Firehose buffers records before delivering them to the destination. To disambiguate the data blobs at the destination, a common solution is to use delimiters in the data, such as a newline (<code>\n</code>) or some other character unique within the data. This allows the consumer application to parse individual data items when reading the data from the destination. The <code>PutRecord</code> operation returns a <code>RecordId</code>, which is a unique string assigned to each record. Producer applications can use this ID for purposes such as auditability and investigation. If the <code>PutRecord</code> operation throws a <code>ServiceUnavailableException</code>, back off and retry. If the exception persists, it is possible that the throughput limits have been exceeded for the delivery stream. Data records sent to Kinesis Data Firehose are stored for 24 hours from the time they are added to a delivery stream as it tries to send the records to the destination. If the destination is unreachable for more than 24 hours, the data is no longer available. <important> Don't concatenate two or more base64 strings to form the data fields of your records.

          Writes multiple data records into a delivery stream in a single call, which can achieve higher throughput per producer than when writing single records. To write single data records into a delivery stream, use <a>PutRecord</a>. Applications using these operations are referred to as producers. For information about service quota, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/limits.html">Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Quota</a>. Each <a>PutRecordBatch</a> request supports up to 500 records. Each record in the request can be as large as 1,000 KB (before base64 encoding), up to a limit of 4 MB for the entire request. These limits cannot be changed. You must specify the name of the delivery stream and the data record when using <a>PutRecord</a>. The data record consists of a data blob that can be up to 1,000 KB in size, and any kind of data. For example, it could be a segment from a log file, geographic location data, website clickstream data, and so on. Kinesis Data Firehose buffers records before delivering them to the destination. To disambiguate the data blobs at the destination, a common solution is to use delimiters in the data, such as a newline (<code>\n</code>) or some other character unique within the data. This allows the consumer application to parse individual data items when reading the data from the destination. The <a>PutRecordBatch</a> response includes a count of failed records, <code>FailedPutCount</code>, and an array of responses, <code>RequestResponses</code>. Even if the <a>PutRecordBatch</a> call succeeds, the value of <code>FailedPutCount</code> may be greater than 0, indicating that there are records for which the operation didn't succeed. Each entry in the <code>RequestResponses</code> array provides additional information about the processed record. It directly correlates with a record in the request array using the same ordering, from the top to the bottom. The response array always includes the same number of records as the request array. <code>RequestResponses</code> includes both successfully and unsuccessfully processed records. Kinesis Data Firehose tries to process all records in each <a>PutRecordBatch</a> request. A single record failure does not stop the processing of subsequent records. A successfully processed record includes a <code>RecordId</code> value, which is unique for the record. An unsuccessfully processed record includes <code>ErrorCode</code> and <code>ErrorMessage</code> values. <code>ErrorCode</code> reflects the type of error, and is one of the following values: <code>ServiceUnavailableException</code> or <code>InternalFailure</code>. <code>ErrorMessage</code> provides more detailed information about the error. If there is an internal server error or a timeout, the write might have completed or it might have failed. If <code>FailedPutCount</code> is greater than 0, retry the request, resending only those records that might have failed processing. This minimizes the possible duplicate records and also reduces the total bytes sent (and corresponding charges). We recommend that you handle any duplicates at the destination. If <a>PutRecordBatch</a> throws <code>ServiceUnavailableException</code>, back off and retry. If the exception persists, it is possible that the throughput limits have been exceeded for the delivery stream.

          Enables server-side encryption (SSE) for the delivery stream. This operation is asynchronous. It returns immediately. When you invoke it, Kinesis Data Firehose first sets the encryption status of the stream to <code>ENABLING</code>, and then to <code>ENABLED</code>. The encryption status of a delivery stream is the <code>Status</code> property in <a>DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfiguration</a>. If the operation fails, the encryption status changes to <code>ENABLING_FAILED</code>. You can continue to read and write data to your delivery stream while the encryption status is <code>ENABLING</code>, but the data is not encrypted. It can take up to 5 seconds after the encryption status changes to <code>ENABLED</code> before all records written to the delivery stream are encrypted. To find out whether a record or a batch of records was encrypted, check the response elements <a>PutRecordOutput$Encrypted</a> and <a>PutRecordBatchOutput$Encrypted</a>, respectively. To check the encryption status of a delivery stream, use <a>DescribeDeliveryStream</a>. Even if encryption is currently enabled for a delivery stream, you can still invoke this operation on it to change the ARN of the CMK or both its type and ARN. If you invoke this method to change the CMK, and the old CMK is of type <code>CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK</code>, Kinesis Data Firehose schedules the grant it had on the old CMK for retirement. If the new CMK is of type <code>CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK</code>, Kinesis Data Firehose creates a grant that enables it to use the new CMK to encrypt and decrypt data and to manage the grant. If a delivery stream already has encryption enabled and then you invoke this operation to change the ARN of the CMK or both its type and ARN and you get <code>ENABLING_FAILED</code>, this only means that the attempt to change the CMK failed. In this case, encryption remains enabled with the old CMK. If the encryption status of your delivery stream is <code>ENABLING_FAILED</code>, you can invoke this operation again with a valid CMK. The CMK must be enabled and the key policy mustn't explicitly deny the permission for Kinesis Data Firehose to invoke KMS encrypt and decrypt operations. You can enable SSE for a delivery stream only if it's a delivery stream that uses <code>DirectPut</code> as its source. The <code>StartDeliveryStreamEncryption</code> and <code>StopDeliveryStreamEncryption</code> operations have a combined limit of 25 calls per delivery stream per 24 hours. For example, you reach the limit if you call <code>StartDeliveryStreamEncryption</code> 13 times and <code>StopDeliveryStreamEncryption</code> 12 times for the same delivery stream in a 24-hour period.

You can continue to read and write data to your stream while its status is <code>DISABLING</code>. It can take up to 5 seconds after the encryption status changes to <code>DISABLED</code> before all records written to the delivery stream are no longer subject to encryption.

To check the encryption state of a delivery stream, use <a>DescribeDeliveryStream</a>. If SSE is enabled using a customer managed CMK and then you invoke <code>StopDeliveryStreamEncryption</code>, Kinesis Data Firehose schedules the related KMS grant for retirement and then retires it after it ensures that it is finished delivering records to the destination. The <code>StartDeliveryStreamEncryption</code> and <code>StopDeliveryStreamEncryption</code> operations have a combined limit of 25 calls per delivery stream per 24 hours.

          Creates an Amazon Forecast dataset. The information about the dataset that you provide helps Forecast understand how to consume the data for model training. This includes the following: <ul> <li> <i> <code>DataFrequency</code> </i> - How frequently your historical time-series data is collected. </li> <li> <i> <code>Domain</code> </i> and <i> <code>DatasetType</code> </i> - Each dataset has an associated dataset domain and a type within the domain. Amazon Forecast provides a list of predefined domains and types within each domain. For each unique dataset domain and type within the domain, Amazon Forecast requires your data to include a minimum set of predefined fields. </li> <li> <i> <code>Schema</code> </i> - A schema specifies the fields in the dataset, including the field name and data type. </li> </ul> After creating a dataset, you import your training data into it and add the dataset to a dataset group. You use the dataset group to create a predictor. For more information, see <a>howitworks-datasets-groups</a>. To get a list of all your datasets, use the <a>ListDatasets</a> operation. For example Forecast datasets, see the <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-forecast-samples">Amazon Forecast Sample GitHub repository</a>. <note> The <code>Status</code> of a dataset must be <code>ACTIVE</code> before you can import training data.

          Imports your training data to an Amazon Forecast dataset. You provide the location of your training data in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset that you want to import the data to. You must specify a <a>DataSource</a> object that includes an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the data, as Amazon Forecast makes a copy of your data and processes it in an internal AWS system. For more information, see <a>aws-forecast-iam-roles</a>. The training data must be in CSV format. The delimiter must be a comma (,). You can specify the path to a specific CSV file, the S3 bucket, or to a folder in the S3 bucket. For the latter two cases, Amazon Forecast imports all files up to the limit of 10,000 files. Because dataset imports are not aggregated, your most recent dataset import is the one that is used when training a predictor or generating a forecast. Make sure that your most recent dataset import contains all of the data you want to model off of, and not just the new data collected since the previous import. To get a list of all your dataset import jobs, filtered by specified criteria, use the <a>ListDatasetImportJobs</a> operation.

          Creates a forecast for each item in the <code>TARGET_TIME_SERIES</code> dataset that was used to train the predictor. This is known as inference. To retrieve the forecast for a single item at low latency, use the operation. To export the complete forecast into your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, use the <a>CreateForecastExportJob</a> operation. The range of the forecast is determined by the <code>ForecastHorizon</code> value, which you specify in the <a>CreatePredictor</a> request. When you query a forecast, you can request a specific date range within the forecast. To get a list of all your forecasts, use the <a>ListForecasts</a> operation. <note> The forecasts generated by Amazon Forecast are in the same time zone as the dataset that was used to create the predictor. </note> For more information, see <a>howitworks-forecast</a>. <note> The <code>Status</code> of the forecast must be <code>ACTIVE</code> before you can query or export the forecast.

          Creates an Amazon Forecast predictor. In the request, provide a dataset group and either specify an algorithm or let Amazon Forecast choose an algorithm for you using AutoML. If you specify an algorithm, you also can override algorithm-specific hyperparameters. Amazon Forecast uses the algorithm to train a predictor using the latest version of the datasets in the specified dataset group. You can then generate a forecast using the <a>CreateForecast</a> operation. To see the evaluation metrics, use the <a>GetAccuracyMetrics</a> operation. You can specify a featurization configuration to fill and aggregate the data fields in the <code>TARGET_TIME_SERIES</code> dataset to improve model training. For more information, see <a>FeaturizationConfig</a>. For RELATED_TIME_SERIES datasets, <code>CreatePredictor</code> verifies that the <code>DataFrequency</code> specified when the dataset was created matches the <code>ForecastFrequency</code>. TARGET_TIME_SERIES datasets don't have this restriction. Amazon Forecast also verifies the delimiter and timestamp format. For more information, see <a>howitworks-datasets-groups</a>. By default, predictors are trained and evaluated at the 0.1 (P10), 0.5 (P50), and 0.9 (P90) quantiles. You can choose custom forecast types to train and evaluate your predictor by setting the <code>ForecastTypes</code>. <b>AutoML</b> If you want Amazon Forecast to evaluate each algorithm and choose the one that minimizes the <code>objective function</code>, set <code>PerformAutoML</code> to <code>true</code>. The <code>objective function</code> is defined as the mean of the weighted losses over the forecast types. By default, these are the p10, p50, and p90 quantile losses. For more information, see <a>EvaluationResult</a>. When AutoML is enabled, the following properties are disallowed: <ul> <li> <code>AlgorithmArn</code> </li> <li> <code>HPOConfig</code> </li> <li> <code>PerformHPO</code> </li> <li> <code>TrainingParameters</code> </li> </ul> To get a list of all of your predictors, use the <a>ListPredictors</a> operation. <note> Before you can use the predictor to create a forecast, the <code>Status</code> of the predictor must be <code>ACTIVE</code>, signifying that training has completed. To get the status, use the <a>DescribePredictor</a> operation. </note>

          Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit. When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status <code>REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE</code>. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error. To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status <code>PLACING</code>, where a new game session is created for the match. If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where one or more players rejected the match, the ticket status is returned to <code>SEARCHING</code> to find a new match. For tickets where one or more players failed to respond, the ticket status is set to <code>CANCELLED</code>, and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted as needed. <b>Learn more</b> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-client.html"> Add FlexMatch to a game client</a> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-events.html"> FlexMatch events</a> (reference) <b>Related actions</b> <a>StartMatchmaking</a>

          <b>This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.</b> Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves it to host gameplay and players. This operation is called from a game client or client service (such as a matchmaker) to request hosting resources for a new game session. In response, GameLift FleetIQ locates an available game server, places it in <code>CLAIMED</code> status for 60 seconds, and returns connection information that players can use to connect to the game server. To claim a game server, identify a game server group. You can also specify a game server ID, although this approach bypasses GameLift FleetIQ placement optimization. Optionally, include game data to pass to the game server at the start of a game session, such as a game map or player information. When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned. A claimed game server's utilization status remains <code>AVAILABLE</code> while the claim status is set to <code>CLAIMED</code> for up to 60 seconds. This time period gives the game server time to update its status to <code>UTILIZED</code> (using <a>UpdateGameServer</a>) once players join. If the game server's status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by another request. The claim time period is a fixed value and is not configurable. If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the following cases: <ul> <li> If the game server utilization status is <code>UTILIZED</code>. </li> <li> If the game server claim status is <code>CLAIMED</code>. </li> </ul> <note> When claiming a specific game server, this request will succeed even if the game server is running on an instance in <code>DRAINING</code> status. To avoid this, first check the instance status by calling <a>DescribeGameServerInstances</a>. </note> <b>Learn more</b> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-intro.html">GameLift FleetIQ Guide</a> <b>Related actions</b> <a>RegisterGameServer</a>

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for a fleet that is useful when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to another, such as when updating your game build. Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site. To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID and an ARN. You can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling <code>UpdateAlias</code>. <b>Related actions</b> <a>CreateAlias</a>

          Creates a new Amazon GameLift build resource for your game server binary files. Game server binaries must be combined into a zip file for use with Amazon GameLift. <important> When setting up a new game build for GameLift, we recommend using the AWS CLI command <b> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/gamelift/upload-build.html">upload-build</a> </b>. This helper command combines two tasks: (1) it uploads your build files from a file directory to a GameLift Amazon S3 location, and (2) it creates a new build resource. </important> The <code>CreateBuild</code> operation can used in the following scenarios: <ul> <li> To create a new game build with build files that are in an Amazon S3 location under an AWS account that you control. To use this option, you must first give Amazon GameLift access to the Amazon S3 bucket. With permissions in place, call <code>CreateBuild</code> and specify a build name, operating system, and the Amazon S3 storage location of your game build. </li> <li> To directly upload your build files to a GameLift Amazon S3 location. To use this option, first call <code>CreateBuild</code> and specify a build name and operating system. This operation creates a new build resource and also returns an Amazon S3 location with temporary access credentials. Use the credentials to manually upload your build files to the specified Amazon S3 location. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UploadingObjects.html">Uploading Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 Developer Guide</i>. Build files can be uploaded to the GameLift Amazon S3 location once only; that can't be updated. </li> </ul> If successful, this operation creates a new build resource with a unique build ID and places it in <code>INITIALIZED</code> status.

          Creates a fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to host your custom game server or Realtime Servers. Use this operation to configure the computing resources for your fleet and provide instructions for running game servers on each instance. Most GameLift fleets can deploy instances to multiple locations, including the home Region (where the fleet is created) and an optional set of remote locations. Fleets that are created in the following AWS Regions support multiple locations: us-east-1 (N. Virginia), us-west-2 (Oregon), eu-central-1 (Frankfurt), eu-west-1 (Ireland), ap-southeast-2 (Sydney), ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo), and ap-northeast-2 (Seoul). Fleets that are created in other GameLift Regions can deploy instances in the fleet's home Region only. All fleet instances use the same configuration regardless of location; however, you can adjust capacity settings and turn auto-scaling on/off for each location. To create a fleet, choose the hardware for your instances, specify a game server build or Realtime script to deploy, and provide a runtime configuration to direct GameLift how to start and run game servers on each instance in the fleet. Set permissions for inbound traffic to your game servers, and enable optional features as needed. When creating a multi-location fleet, provide a list of additional remote locations. If successful, this operation creates a new Fleet resource and places it in <code>NEW</code> status, which prompts GameLift to initiate the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-creation-workflow.html">fleet creation workflow</a>. You can track fleet creation by checking fleet status using <a>DescribeFleetAttributes</a> and <a>DescribeFleetLocationAttributes</a>/, or by monitoring fleet creation events using <a>DescribeFleetEvents</a>. As soon as the fleet status changes to <code>ACTIVE</code>, you can enable automatic scaling for the fleet with <a>PutScalingPolicy</a> and set capacity for the home Region with <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a>. When the status of each remote location reaches <code>ACTIVE</code>, you can set capacity by location using <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a>. <b>Learn more</b> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-intro.html">Setting up fleets</a> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-creating-debug.html#fleets-creating-debug-creation">Debug fleet creation issues</a> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-intro.html">Multi-location fleets</a> <b>Related actions</b> <a>CreateFleet</a>

Fleets can have multiple locations only if they reside in AWS Regions that support this feature (see <a>CreateFleet</a> for the complete list) and were created after the feature was released in March 2021. </note> To add fleet locations, specify the fleet to be updated and provide a list of one or more locations. If successful, this operation returns the list of added locations with their status set to <code>NEW</code>. GameLift initiates the process of starting an instance in each added location. You can track the status of each new location by monitoring location creation events using <a>DescribeFleetEvents</a>. Alternatively, you can poll location status by calling <a>DescribeFleetLocationAttributes</a>.

          <b>This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.</b> Creates a GameLift FleetIQ game server group for managing game hosting on a collection of Amazon EC2 instances for game hosting. This operation creates the game server group, creates an Auto Scaling group in your AWS account, and establishes a link between the two groups. You can view the status of your game server groups in the GameLift console. Game server group metrics and events are emitted to Amazon CloudWatch. Before creating a new game server group, you must have the following: <ul> <li> An Amazon EC2 launch template that specifies how to launch Amazon EC2 instances with your game server build. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html"> Launching an Instance from a Launch Template</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>. </li> <li> An IAM role that extends limited access to your AWS account to allow GameLift FleetIQ to create and interact with the Auto Scaling group. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-iam-permissions-roles.html">Create IAM roles for cross-service interaction</a> in the <i>GameLift FleetIQ Developer Guide</i>. </li> </ul> To create a new game server group, specify a unique group name, IAM role and Amazon EC2 launch template, and provide a list of instance types that can be used in the group. You must also set initial maximum and minimum limits on the group's instance count. You can optionally set an Auto Scaling policy with target tracking based on a GameLift FleetIQ metric. Once the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are created, you have full access to change the Auto Scaling group's configuration as needed. Several properties that are set when creating a game server group, including maximum/minimum size and auto-scaling policy settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling group. Keep in mind that some Auto Scaling group properties are periodically updated by GameLift FleetIQ as part of its balancing activities to optimize for availability and cost. <b>Learn more</b> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-intro.html">GameLift FleetIQ Guide</a> <b>Related actions</b> <a>CreateGameServerGroup</a>

          Creates a multiplayer game session for players in a specific fleet location. This operation prompts an available server process to start a game session and retrieves connection information for the new game session. As an alternative, consider using the GameLift game session placement feature with with <a>StartGameSessionPlacement</a>, which uses FleetIQ algorithms and queues to optimize the placement process. When creating a game session, you specify exactly where you want to place it and provide a set of game session configuration settings. The fleet must be in <code>ACTIVE</code> status before a game session can be created in it. This operation can be used in the following ways: <ul> <li> To create a game session on an instance in a fleet's home Region, provide a fleet or alias ID along with your game session configuration. </li> <li> To create a game session on an instance in a fleet's remote location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name, along with your game session configuration. </li> </ul> If successful, a workflow is initiated to start a new game session. A <code>GameSession</code> object is returned containing the game session configuration and status. When the status is <code>ACTIVE</code>, game session connection information is provided and player sessions can be created for the game session. By default, newly created game sessions are open to new players. You can restrict new player access by using <a>UpdateGameSession</a> to change the game session's player session creation policy. Game session logs are retained for all active game sessions for 14 days. To access the logs, call <a>GetGameSessionLogUrl</a> to download the log files. <i>Available in GameLift Local.</i> <b>Learn more</b> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession">Start a game session</a> <b>Related actions</b> <a>CreateGameSession</a>

          Creates a placement queue that processes requests for new game sessions. A queue uses FleetIQ algorithms to determine the best placement locations and find an available game server there, then prompts the game server process to start a new game session. A game session queue is configured with a set of destinations (GameLift fleets or aliases), which determine the locations where the queue can place new game sessions. These destinations can span multiple fleet types (Spot and On-Demand), instance types, and AWS Regions. If the queue includes multi-location fleets, the queue is able to place game sessions in all of a fleet's remote locations. You can opt to filter out individual locations if needed. The queue configuration also determines how FleetIQ selects the best available placement for a new game session. Before searching for an available game server, FleetIQ first prioritizes the queue's destinations and locations, with the best placement locations on top. You can set up the queue to use the FleetIQ default prioritization or provide an alternate set of priorities. To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, and a list of destinations. Optionally, specify a sort configuration and/or a filter, and define a set of latency cap policies. You can also include the ARN for an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic to receive notifications of game session placement activity. Notifications using SNS or CloudWatch events is the preferred way to track placement activity. If successful, a new <code>GameSessionQueue</code> object is returned with an assigned queue ARN. New game session requests, which are submitted to the queue with <a>StartGameSessionPlacement</a> or <a>StartMatchmaking</a>, reference a queue's name or ARN. <b>Learn more</b> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/queues-design.html"> Design a game session queue</a> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/queues-creating.html"> Create a game session queue</a> <b>Related actions</b> <a>CreateGameSessionQueue</a>

If you're also using GameLift hosting, it defines how to start game sessions for each match. Your matchmaking system can use multiple configurations to handle different game scenarios. All matchmaking requests (<a>StartMatchmaking</a> or <a>StartMatchBackfill</a>) identify the matchmaking configuration to use and provide player attributes consistent with that configuration. To create a matchmaking configuration, you must provide the following: configuration name and FlexMatch mode (with or without GameLift hosting); a rule set that specifies how to evaluate players and find acceptable matches; whether player acceptance is required; and the maximum time allowed for a matchmaking attempt. When using FlexMatch with GameLift hosting, you also need to identify the game session queue to use when starting a game session for the match. In addition, you must set up an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic to receive matchmaking notifications. Provide the topic ARN in the matchmaking configuration.

Identify the following values: (1) The ID of the fleet you want to be enable a VPC peering connection for; (2) The AWS account with the VPC that you want to peer with; and (3) The ID of the VPC you want to peer with. This operation is asynchronous. If successful, a <a>VpcPeeringConnection</a> request is created. You can use continuous polling to track the request's status using <a>DescribeVpcPeeringConnections</a>, or by monitoring fleet events for success or failure using <a>DescribeFleetEvents</a>. <b>Related actions</b> <a>CreateVpcPeeringAuthorization</a>

          Removes locations from a multi-location fleet. When deleting a location, all game server process and all instances that are still active in the location are shut down. To delete fleet locations, identify the fleet ID and provide a list of the locations to be deleted. If successful, GameLift sets the location status to <code>DELETING</code>, and begins to shut down existing server processes and terminate instances in each location being deleted. When completed, the location status changes to <code>TERMINATED</code>. <b>Learn more</b> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-intro.html">Setting up GameLift fleets</a> <b>Related actions</b> <a>CreateFleetLocations</a>

          <b>This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.</b> Terminates a game server group and permanently deletes the game server group record. You have several options for how these resources are impacted when deleting the game server group. Depending on the type of delete operation selected, this operation might affect these resources: <ul> <li> The game server group </li> <li> The corresponding Auto Scaling group </li> <li> All game servers that are currently running in the group </li> </ul> To delete a game server group, identify the game server group to delete and specify the type of delete operation to initiate. Game server groups can only be deleted if they are in <code>ACTIVE</code> or <code>ERROR</code> status. If the delete request is successful, a series of operations are kicked off. The game server group status is changed to <code>DELETE_SCHEDULED</code>, which prevents new game servers from being registered and stops automatic scaling activity. Once all game servers in the game server group are deregistered, GameLift FleetIQ can begin deleting resources. If any of the delete operations fail, the game server group is placed in <code>ERROR</code> status. GameLift FleetIQ emits delete events to Amazon CloudWatch. <b>Learn more</b> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-intro.html">GameLift FleetIQ Guide</a> <b>Related actions</b> <a>CreateGameServerGroup</a>

          The GameLift service limits and current utilization for an AWS Region or location. Instance limits control the number of instances, per instance type, per location, that your AWS account can use. Learn more at <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">Amazon EC2 Instance Types</a>. The information returned includes the maximum number of instances allowed and your account's current usage across all fleets. This information can affect your ability to scale your GameLift fleets. You can request a limit increase for your account by using the <b>Service limits</b> page in the GameLift console. Instance limits differ based on whether the instances are deployed in a fleet's home Region or in a remote location. For remote locations, limits also differ based on the combination of home Region and remote location. All requests must specify an AWS Region (either explicitly or as your default settings). To get the limit for a remote location, you must also specify the location. For example, the following requests all return different results: <ul> <li> Request specifies the Region <code>ap-northeast-1</code> with no location. The result is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed in <code>us-east-2</code>, by all of the fleets that reside in <code>ap-northeast-1</code>. </li> <li> Request specifies the Region <code>us-east-1</code> with location <code>ca-central-1</code>. The result is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed in <code>ca-central-1</code>, by all of the fleets that reside in <code>us-east-2</code>. These limits do not affect fleets in any other Regions that deploy instances to <code>ca-central-1</code>. </li> <li> Request specifies the Region <code>eu-west-1</code> with location <code>ca-central-1</code>. The result is limits and usage data on all instance types that are deployed in <code>ca-central-1</code>, by all of the fleets that reside in <code>eu-west-1</code>. </li> </ul> This operation can be used in the following ways: <ul> <li> To get limit and usage data for all instance types that are deployed in an AWS Region by fleets that reside in the same Region: Specify the Region only. Optionally, specify a single instance type to retrieve information for. </li> <li> To get limit and usage data for all instance types that are deployed to a remote location by fleets that reside in different AWS Region: Provide both the AWS Region and the remote location.

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences. You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling <a>StopFleetActions</a> with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call <a>StartFleetActions</a> with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove it, you must delete the policy with <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a>. Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html">Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling</a>. <b>Target-based policy</b> A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target. For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer. To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a <a>TargetConfiguration</a> object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted. <b>Rule-based policy</b> A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action. For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%." A policy's rule statement has the following structure: If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code> <code>[Threshold]</code> for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code> to/by <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>. To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this: If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code> <code>[20]</code> for <code>[15]</code> minutes, then <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>. To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted. <b>Related actions</b> <a>DescribeFleetCapacity</a>

          Places a request for a new game session in a queue (see <a>CreateGameSessionQueue</a>). When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift searches for available resources on the queue's destinations, scanning each until it finds resources or the placement request times out. A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a new game session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a player session for each player included in the request. When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in the order they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a queue's destinations are listed in preference order. Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency data for each player in relevant Regions. Latency data indicates the performance lag a player experiences when connected to a fleet in the Region. Amazon GameLift uses latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a Region with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift calculates each Region's average lag for all players and reorders to get the best game play across all players. To place a new game session request, specify the following: <ul> <li> The queue name and a set of game session properties and settings </li> <li> A unique ID (such as a UUID) for the placement. You use this ID to track the status of the placement request </li> <li> (Optional) A set of player data and a unique player ID for each player that you are joining to the new game session (player data is optional, but if you include it, you must also provide a unique ID for each player) </li> <li> Latency data for all players (if you want to optimize game play for the players) </li> </ul> If successful, a new game session placement is created. To track the status of a placement request, call <a>DescribeGameSessionPlacement</a> and check the request's status. If the status is <code>FULFILLED</code>, a new game session has been created and a game session ARN and Region are referenced. If the placement request times out, you can resubmit the request or retry it with a different queue. <b>Related actions</b> <a>CreateGameSession</a>

          Finds new players to fill open slots in currently running game sessions. The backfill match process is essentially identical to the process of forming new matches. Backfill requests use the same matchmaker that was used to make the original match, and they provide matchmaking data for all players currently in the game session. FlexMatch uses this information to select new players so that backfilled match continues to meet the original match requirements. When using FlexMatch with GameLift managed hosting, you can request a backfill match from a client service by calling this operation with a <a>GameSession</a> identifier. You also have the option of making backfill requests directly from your game server. In response to a request, FlexMatch creates player sessions for the new players, updates the <code>GameSession</code> resource, and sends updated matchmaking data to the game server. You can request a backfill match at any point after a game session is started. Each game session can have only one active backfill request at a time; a subsequent request automatically replaces the earlier request. When using FlexMatch as a standalone component, request a backfill match by calling this operation without a game session identifier. As with newly formed matches, matchmaking results are returned in a matchmaking event so that your game can update the game session that is being backfilled. To request a backfill match, specify a unique ticket ID, the original matchmaking configuration, and matchmaking data for all current players in the game session being backfilled. Optionally, specify the <code>GameSession</code> ARN. If successful, a match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. Track the status of backfill tickets using the same method for tracking tickets for new matches. <b>Learn more</b> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-backfill.html"> Backfill existing games with FlexMatch</a> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-events.html"> Matchmaking events</a> (reference) <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/gamelift-match.html"> How GameLift FlexMatch works</a> <b>Related actions</b> <a>StartMatchmaking</a>

          Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking rules. With games that use GameLift managed hosting, this operation also triggers GameLift to find hosting resources and start a new game session for the new match. Each matchmaking request includes information on one or more players and specifies the FlexMatch matchmaker to use. When a request is for multiple players, FlexMatch attempts to build a match that includes all players in the request, placing them in the same team and finding additional players as needed to fill the match. To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration, and include the players to be matched. You must also include any player attributes that are required by the matchmaking configuration's rule set. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is returned with status set to <code>QUEUED</code>. Track matchmaking events to respond as needed and acquire game session connection information for successfully completed matches. Ticket status updates are tracked using event notification through Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), which is defined in the matchmaking configuration. <b>Learn more</b> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-client.html"> Add FlexMatch to a game client</a> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-notification.html"> Set Up FlexMatch event notification</a> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/gamelift-match.html"> How GameLift FlexMatch works</a> <b>Related actions</b> <a>StartMatchmaking</a>

If a game server does not report health status for a certain length of time, the game server is no longer considered healthy. As a result, it will be eventually deregistered from the game server group to avoid affecting utilization metrics. The best practice is to report health every 60 seconds. </li> <li> To change game server metadata, provide updated game server data. </li> </ul> Once a game server is successfully updated, the relevant statuses and timestamps are updated. <b>Learn more</b> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-intro.html">GameLift FleetIQ Guide</a> <b>Related actions</b> <a>RegisterGameServer</a>

          You call this operation to inform Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) that all the archive parts have been uploaded and that Glacier can now assemble the archive from the uploaded parts. After assembling and saving the archive to the vault, Glacier returns the URI path of the newly created archive resource. Using the URI path, you can then access the archive. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned to retrieve the archive at a later point. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see <a>InitiateJob</a>. In the request, you must include the computed SHA256 tree hash of the entire archive you have uploaded. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html">Computing Checksums</a>. On the server side, Glacier also constructs the SHA256 tree hash of the assembled archive. If the values match, Glacier saves the archive to the vault; otherwise, it returns an error, and the operation fails. The <a>ListParts</a> operation returns a list of parts uploaded for a specific multipart upload. It includes checksum information for each uploaded part that can be used to debug a bad checksum issue. Additionally, Glacier also checks for any missing content ranges when assembling the archive, if missing content ranges are found, Glacier returns an error and the operation fails. Complete Multipart Upload is an idempotent operation. After your first successful complete multipart upload, if you call the operation again within a short period, the operation will succeed and return the same archive ID. This is useful in the event you experience a network issue that causes an aborted connection or receive a 500 server error, in which case you can repeat your Complete Multipart Upload request and get the same archive ID without creating duplicate archives. Note, however, that after the multipart upload completes, you cannot call the List Parts operation and the multipart upload will not appear in List Multipart Uploads response, even if idempotent complete is possible. An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.

          This operation initiates a multipart upload. Amazon S3 Glacier creates a multipart upload resource and returns its ID in the response. The multipart upload ID is used in subsequent requests to upload parts of an archive (see <a>UploadMultipartPart</a>). When you initiate a multipart upload, you specify the part size in number of bytes. The part size must be a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied by a power of 2-for example, 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB), 4194304 (4 MB), 8388608 (8 MB), and so on. The minimum allowable part size is 1 MB, and the maximum is 4 GB. Every part you upload to this resource (see <a>UploadMultipartPart</a>), except the last one, must have the same size. The last one can be the same size or smaller. For example, suppose you want to upload a 16.2 MB file. If you initiate the multipart upload with a part size of 4 MB, you will upload four parts of 4 MB each and one part of 0.2 MB. <note> You don't need to know the size of the archive when you start a multipart upload because Amazon S3 Glacier does not require you to specify the overall archive size. </note> After you complete the multipart upload, Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) removes the multipart upload resource referenced by the ID. Glacier also removes the multipart upload resource if you cancel the multipart upload or it may be removed if there is no activity for a period of 24 hours.

The List Job operation returns a list of these jobs sorted by job initiation time. <note> Amazon Glacier retains recently completed jobs for a period before deleting them; however, it eventually removes completed jobs. The output of completed jobs can be retrieved. Retaining completed jobs for a period of time after they have completed enables you to get a job output in the event you miss the job completion notification or your first attempt to download it fails. For example, suppose you start an archive retrieval job to download an archive. After the job completes, you start to download the archive but encounter a network error. In this scenario, you can retry and download the archive while the job exists. </note> The List Jobs operation supports pagination. You should always check the response <code>Marker</code> field. If there are no more jobs to list, the <code>Marker</code> field is set to <code>null</code>. If there are more jobs to list, the <code>Marker</code> field is set to a non-null value, which you can use to continue the pagination of the list. To return a list of jobs that begins at a specific job, set the marker request parameter to the <code>Marker</code> value for that job that you obtained from a previous List Jobs request. You can set a maximum limit for the number of jobs returned in the response by specifying the <code>limit</code> parameter in the request. The default limit is 50. The number of jobs returned might be fewer than the limit, but the number of returned jobs never exceeds the limit. Additionally, you can filter the jobs list returned by specifying the optional <code>statuscode</code> parameter or <code>completed</code> parameter, or both. Using the <code>statuscode</code> parameter, you can specify to return only jobs that match either the <code>InProgress</code>, <code>Succeeded</code>, or <code>Failed</code> status.

          This operation adds an archive to a vault. This is a synchronous operation, and for a successful upload, your data is durably persisted. Amazon S3 Glacier returns the archive ID in the <code>x-amz-archive-id</code> header of the response. You must use the archive ID to access your data in Amazon S3 Glacier. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned so that you can retrieve or delete the archive later. Besides saving the archive ID, you can also index it and give it a friendly name to allow for better searching. You can also use the optional archive description field to specify how the archive is referred to in an external index of archives, such as you might create in Amazon DynamoDB. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see <a>InitiateJob</a>. You must provide a SHA256 tree hash of the data you are uploading. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/checksum-calculations.html">Computing Checksums</a>. You can optionally specify an archive description of up to 1,024 printable ASCII characters. You can get the archive description when you either retrieve the archive or get the vault inventory. For more information, see <a>InitiateJob</a>. Amazon Glacier does not interpret the description in any way. An archive description does not need to be unique. You cannot use the description to retrieve or sort the archive list. Archives are immutable. After you upload an archive, you cannot edit the archive or its description. An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/using-iam-with-amazon-glacier.html">Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a>. For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/uploading-an-archive.html">Uploading an Archive in Amazon Glacier</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/api-archive-post.html">Upload Archive</a> in the <i>Amazon Glacier Developer Guide</i>.

          Associate a virtual private cloud (VPC) subnet endpoint with your custom routing accelerator. The listener port range must be large enough to support the number of IP addresses that can be specified in your subnet. The number of ports required is: subnet size times the number of ports per destination EC2 instances. For example, a subnet defined as /24 requires a listener port range of at least 255 ports. Note: You must have enough remaining listener ports available to map to the subnet ports, or the call will fail with a LimitExceededException. By default, all destinations in a subnet in a custom routing accelerator cannot receive traffic. To enable all destinations to receive traffic, or to specify individual port mappings that can receive traffic, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/api/API_AllowCustomRoutingTraffic.html"> AllowCustomRoutingTraffic</a> operation.

          Provides a complete mapping from the public accelerator IP address and port to destination EC2 instance IP addresses and ports in the virtual public cloud (VPC) subnet endpoint for a custom routing accelerator. For each subnet endpoint that you add, Global Accelerator creates a new static port mapping for the accelerator. The port mappings don't change after Global Accelerator generates them, so you can retrieve and cache the full mapping on your servers. If you remove a subnet from your accelerator, Global Accelerator removes (reclaims) the port mappings. If you add a subnet to your accelerator, Global Accelerator creates new port mappings (the existing ones don't change). If you add or remove EC2 instances in your subnet, the port mappings don't change, because the mappings are created when you add the subnet to Global Accelerator. The mappings also include a flag for each destination denoting which destination IP addresses and ports are allowed or denied traffic.

          Creates a component. Components are software that run on Greengrass core devices. After you develop and test a component on your core device, you can use this operation to upload your component to IoT Greengrass. Then, you can deploy the component to other core devices. You can use this operation to do the following: <ul> <li> <b>Create components from recipes</b> Create a component from a recipe, which is a file that defines the component's metadata, parameters, dependencies, lifecycle, artifacts, and platform capability. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/component-recipe-reference.html">IoT Greengrass component recipe reference</a> in the <i>IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide</i>. To create a component from a recipe, specify <code>inlineRecipe</code> when you call this operation. </li> <li> <b>Create components from Lambda functions</b> Create a component from an Lambda function that runs on IoT Greengrass. This creates a recipe and artifacts from the Lambda function's deployment package. You can use this operation to migrate Lambda functions from IoT Greengrass V1 to IoT Greengrass V2. This function only accepts Lambda functions that use the following runtimes: <ul> <li> Python 2.7 â€“ <code>python2.7</code> </li> <li> Python 3.7 â€“ <code>python3.7</code> </li> <li> Python 3.8 â€“ <code>python3.8</code> </li> <li> Java 8 â€“ <code>java8</code> </li> <li> Node.js 10 â€“ <code>nodejs10.x</code> </li> <li> Node.js 12 â€“ <code>nodejs12.x</code> </li> </ul> To create a component from a Lambda function, specify <code>lambdaFunction</code> when you call this operation. </li> </ul>

          Creates a continuous deployment for a target, which is a Greengrass core device or group of core devices. When you add a new core device to a group of core devices that has a deployment, IoT Greengrass deploys that group's deployment to the new device. You can define one deployment for each target. When you create a new deployment for a target that has an existing deployment, you replace the previous deployment. IoT Greengrass applies the new deployment to the target devices. Every deployment has a revision number that indicates how many deployment revisions you define for a target. Use this operation to create a new revision of an existing deployment. This operation returns the revision number of the new deployment when you create it.

          Retrieves a list of components that meet the component, version, and platform requirements of a deployment. Greengrass core devices call this operation when they receive a deployment to identify the components to install. This operation identifies components that meet all dependency requirements for a deployment. If the requirements conflict, then this operation returns an error and the deployment fails. For example, this occurs if component <code>A</code> requires version <code>&gt;2.0.0</code> and component <code>B</code> requires version <code>&lt;2.0.0</code> of a component dependency. When you specify the component candidates to resolve, IoT Greengrass compares each component's digest from the core device with the component's digest in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. If the digests don't match, then IoT Greengrass specifies to use the version from the Amazon Web Services Cloud. <important> To use this operation, you must use the data plane API endpoint and authenticate with an IoT device certificate. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/greengrass.html">IoT Greengrass endpoints and quotas</a>. </important>

          Returns information about events across your organization in AWS Organizations. You can use the<code>filters</code> parameter to specify the events that you want to return. Events are returned in a summary form and don't include the affected accounts, detailed description, any additional metadata that depends on the event type, or any affected resources. To retrieve that information, use the following operations: <ul> <li> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAffectedAccountsForOrganization.html">DescribeAffectedAccountsForOrganization</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization.html">DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAffectedEntitiesForOrganization.html">DescribeAffectedEntitiesForOrganization</a> </li> </ul> If you don't specify a <code>filter</code>, the <code>DescribeEventsForOrganizations</code> returns all events across your organization. Results are sorted by <code>lastModifiedTime</code>, starting with the most recent event. For more information about the different types of AWS Health events, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html">Event</a>. Before you can call this operation, you must first enable AWS Health to work with AWS Organizations. To do this, call the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization.html">EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization</a> operation from your organization's management account. <note> This API operation uses pagination. Specify the <code>nextToken</code> parameter in the next request to return more results. </note>

          The BatchCreateTableRows API allows you to create one or more rows at the end of a table in a workbook. The API allows you to specify the values to set in some or all of the columns in the new rows. If a column is not explicitly set in a specific row, then the column level formula specified in the table will be applied to the new row. If there is no column level formula but the last row of the table has a formula, then that formula will be copied down to the new row. If there is no column level formula and no formula in the last row of the table, then that column will be left blank for the new rows.

          The BatchUpsertTableRows API allows you to upsert one or more rows in a table. The upsert operation takes a filter expression as input and evaluates it to find matching rows on the destination table. If matching rows are found, it will update the cells in the matching rows to new values specified in the request. If no matching rows are found, a new row is added at the end of the table and the cells in that row are set to the new values specified in the request. You can specify the values to set in some or all of the columns in the table for the matching or newly appended rows. If a column is not explicitly specified for a particular row, then that column will not be updated for that row. To clear out the data in a specific cell, you need to set the value as an empty string ("").

          Creates a new Amazon Web Services secret access key and corresponding Amazon Web Services access key ID for the specified user. The default status for new keys is <code>Active</code>. If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID signing the request. This operation works for access keys under the Amazon Web Services account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage Amazon Web Services account root user credentials. This is true even if the Amazon Web Services account has no associated users. For information about quotas on the number of keys you can create, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html">IAM and STS quotas</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. <important> To ensure the security of your Amazon Web Services account, the secret access key is accessible only during key and user creation. You must save the key (for example, in a text file) if you want to be able to access it again. If a secret key is lost, you can delete the access keys for the associated user and then create new keys. </important>

          Creates an IAM entity to describe an identity provider (IdP) that supports <a href="http://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect (OIDC)</a>. The OIDC provider that you create with this operation can be used as a principal in a role's trust policy. Such a policy establishes a trust relationship between Amazon Web Services and the OIDC provider. If you are using an OIDC identity provider from Google, Facebook, or Amazon Cognito, you don't need to create a separate IAM identity provider. These OIDC identity providers are already built-in to Amazon Web Services and are available for your use. Instead, you can move directly to creating new roles using your identity provider. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html">Creating a role for web identity or OpenID connect federation</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. When you create the IAM OIDC provider, you specify the following: <ul> <li> The URL of the OIDC identity provider (IdP) to trust </li> <li> A list of client IDs (also known as audiences) that identify the application or applications allowed to authenticate using the OIDC provider </li> <li> A list of thumbprints of one or more server certificates that the IdP uses </li> </ul> You get all of this information from the OIDC IdP you want to use to access Amazon Web Services. <note> Amazon Web Services secures communication with some OIDC identity providers (IdPs) through our library of trusted certificate authorities (CAs) instead of using a certificate thumbprint to verify your IdP server certificate. These OIDC IdPs include Google, and those that use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint. In these cases, your legacy thumbprint remains in your configuration, but is no longer used for validation. </note> <note> The trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the IAM provider that this operation creates. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the <a>CreateOpenIDConnectProvider</a> operation to highly privileged users. </note>

If the policy has five versions, you must delete an existing version using <a>DeletePolicyVersion</a> before you create a new version. Optionally, you can set the new version as the policy's default version. The default version is the version that is in effect for the IAM users, groups, and roles to which the policy is attached.

          Creates an IAM resource that describes an identity provider (IdP) that supports SAML 2.0. The SAML provider resource that you create with this operation can be used as a principal in an IAM role's trust policy. Such a policy can enable federated users who sign in using the SAML IdP to assume the role. You can create an IAM role that supports Web-based single sign-on (SSO) to the Amazon Web Services Management Console or one that supports API access to Amazon Web Services. When you create the SAML provider resource, you upload a SAML metadata document that you get from your IdP. That document includes the issuer's name, expiration information, and keys that can be used to validate the SAML authentication response (assertions) that the IdP sends. You must generate the metadata document using the identity management software that is used as your organization's IdP. <note> This operation requires <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4</a>. </note> For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-saml.html">Enabling SAML 2.0 federated users to access the Amazon Web Services Management Console</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html">About SAML 2.0-based federation</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.

          Creates a new virtual MFA device for the Amazon Web Services account. After creating the virtual MFA, use <a>EnableMFADevice</a> to attach the MFA device to an IAM user. For more information about creating and working with virtual MFA devices, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_VirtualMFA.html">Using a virtual MFA device</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. For information about the maximum number of MFA devices you can create, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html">IAM and STS quotas</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. <important> The seed information contained in the QR code and the Base32 string should be treated like any other secret access information. In other words, protect the seed information as you would your Amazon Web Services access keys or your passwords. After you provision your virtual device, you should ensure that the information is destroyed following secure procedures. </important>

          Submits a service-linked role deletion request and returns a <code>DeletionTaskId</code>, which you can use to check the status of the deletion. Before you call this operation, confirm that the role has no active sessions and that any resources used by the role in the linked service are deleted. If you call this operation more than once for the same service-linked role and an earlier deletion task is not complete, then the <code>DeletionTaskId</code> of the earlier request is returned. If you submit a deletion request for a service-linked role whose linked service is still accessing a resource, then the deletion task fails. If it fails, the <a>GetServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus</a> operation returns the reason for the failure, usually including the resources that must be deleted. To delete the service-linked role, you must first remove those resources from the linked service and then submit the deletion request again. Resources are specific to the service that is linked to the role. For more information about removing resources from a service, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services documentation</a> for your service. For more information about service-linked roles, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role">Roles terms and concepts: Amazon Web Services service-linked role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.

          Generates a report for service last accessed data for Organizations. You can generate a report for any entities (organization root, organizational unit, or account) or policies in your organization. To call this operation, you must be signed in using your Organizations management account credentials. You can use your long-term IAM user or root user credentials, or temporary credentials from assuming an IAM role. SCPs must be enabled for your organization root. You must have the required IAM and Organizations permissions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html">Refining permissions using service last accessed data</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. You can generate a service last accessed data report for entities by specifying only the entity's path. This data includes a list of services that are allowed by any service control policies (SCPs) that apply to the entity. You can generate a service last accessed data report for a policy by specifying an entity's path and an optional Organizations policy ID. This data includes a list of services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service in both report types, the data includes the most recent account activity that the policy allows to account principals in the entity or the entity's children. For important information about the data, reporting period, permissions required, troubleshooting, and supported Regions see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html">Reducing permissions using service last accessed data</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. <important> The data includesÂ allÂ attempts to access Amazon Web Services, not just the successful ones. This includes all attempts that were made using the Amazon Web Services Management Console, the Amazon Web Services API through any of the SDKs, or any of the command line tools. An unexpected entry in the service last accessed data does not mean that an account has been compromised, because the request might have been denied. Refer to your CloudTrail logs as the authoritative source for information about all API calls and whether they were successful or denied access.

When the job is complete, you can retrieve the report. To generate a service last accessed data report for entities, specify an entity path without specifying the optional Organizations policy ID. The type of entity that you specify determines the data returned in the report. <ul> <li> <b>Root</b> â€“ When you specify the organizations root as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached to your root. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in your organization except the management account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs. </li> <li> <b>OU</b> â€“ When you specify an organizational unit (OU) as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached to the OU and its parents.

You can use the <code>JobId</code> parameter in <code>GetServiceLastAccessedDetails</code> to retrieve the status of your report job. When the report is complete, you can retrieve the generated report. The report includes a list of Amazon Web Services services that the resource (user, group, role, or managed policy) can access. <note> Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when determining whether a resource could access a service. These other policy types include resource-based policies, access control lists, Organizations policies, IAM permissions boundaries, and STS assume role policies. It only applies permissions policy logic. For more about the evaluation of policy types, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-basics">Evaluating policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </note> For each service that the resource could access using permissions policies, the operation returns details about the most recent access attempt. If there was no attempt, the service is listed without details about the most recent attempt to access the service. If the operation fails, the <code>GetServiceLastAccessedDetails</code> operation returns the reason that it failed. The <code>GetServiceLastAccessedDetails</code> operation returns a list of services. This list includes the number of entities that have attempted to access the service and the date and time of the last attempt. It also returns the ARN of the following entity, depending on the resource ARN that you used to generate the report: <ul> <li> <b>User</b> â€“ Returns the user ARN that you used to generate the report </li> <li> <b>Group</b> â€“ Returns the ARN of the group member (user) that last attempted to access the service </li> <li> <b>Role</b> â€“ Returns the role ARN that you used to generate the report </li> <li> <b>Policy</b> â€“ Returns the ARN of the user or role that last used the policy to attempt to access the service </li> </ul> By default, the list is sorted by service namespace. If you specified <code>ACTION_LEVEL</code> granularity when you generated the report, this operation returns service and action last accessed data. This includes the most recent access attempt for each tracked action within a service. Otherwise, this operation returns only service data.

          Sends a list of asset property values to IoT SiteWise. Each value is a timestamp-quality-value (TQV) data point. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/ingest-api.html">Ingesting data using the API</a> in the <i>IoT SiteWise User Guide</i>. To identify an asset property, you must specify one of the following: <ul> <li> The <code>assetId</code> and <code>propertyId</code> of an asset property. </li> <li> A <code>propertyAlias</code>, which is a data stream alias (for example, <code>/company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature</code>). To define an asset property's alias, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAssetProperty.html">UpdateAssetProperty</a>. </li> </ul> <important> With respect to Unix epoch time, IoT SiteWise accepts only TQVs that have a timestamp of no more than 7 days in the past and no more than 10 minutes in the future. IoT SiteWise rejects timestamps outside of the inclusive range of [-7 days, +10 minutes] and returns a <code>TimestampOutOfRangeException</code> error. For each asset property, IoT SiteWise overwrites TQVs with duplicate timestamps unless the newer TQV has a different quality. For example, if you store a TQV <code>{T1, GOOD, V1}</code>, then storing <code>{T1, GOOD, V2}</code> replaces the existing TQV. </important> IoT SiteWise authorizes access to each <code>BatchPutAssetPropertyValue</code> entry individually. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-batchputassetpropertyvalue-action">BatchPutAssetPropertyValue authorization</a> in the <i>IoT SiteWise User Guide</i>.

          Creates a system instance. This action validates the system instance, prepares the deployment-related resources. For Greengrass deployments, it updates the Greengrass group that is specified by the <code>greengrassGroupName</code> parameter. It also adds a file to the S3 bucket specified by the <code>s3BucketName</code> parameter. You need to call <code>DeploySystemInstance</code> after running this action. For Greengrass deployments, since this action modifies and adds resources to a Greengrass group and an S3 bucket on the caller's behalf, the calling identity must have write permissions to both the specified Greengrass group and S3 bucket. Otherwise, the call will fail with an authorization error. For cloud deployments, this action requires a <code>flowActionsRoleArn</code> value. This is an IAM role that has permissions to access AWS services, such as AWS Lambda and AWS IoT, that the flow uses when it executes. If the definition document doesn't specify a version of the user's namespace, the latest version will be used by default.

          Creates a new recording configuration, used to enable recording to Amazon S3. <b>Known issue:</b> In the us-east-1 region, if you use the Amazon Web Services CLI to create a recording configuration, it returns success even if the S3 bucket is in a different region. In this case, the <code>state</code> of the recording configuration is <code>CREATE_FAILED</code> (instead of <code>ACTIVE</code>). (In other regions, the CLI correctly returns failure if the bucket is in a different region.) <b>Workaround:</b> Ensure that your S3 bucket is in the same region as the recording configuration. If you create a recording configuration in a different region as your S3 bucket, delete that recording configuration and create a new one with an S3 bucket from the correct region.

          Creates a stream key, used to initiate a stream, for the specified channel ARN. Note that <a>CreateChannel</a> creates a stream key. If you subsequently use CreateStreamKey on the same channel, it will fail because a stream key already exists and there is a limit of 1 stream key per channel. To reset the stream key on a channel, use <a>DeleteStreamKey</a> and then CreateStreamKey.

          Use this API to retrieve media content from a Kinesis video stream. In the request, you identify the stream name or stream Amazon Resource Name (ARN), and the starting chunk. Kinesis Video Streams then returns a stream of chunks in order by fragment number. <note> You must first call the <code>GetDataEndpoint</code> API to get an endpoint. Then send the <code>GetMedia</code> requests to this endpoint using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/">--endpoint-url parameter</a>. </note> When you put media data (fragments) on a stream, Kinesis Video Streams stores each incoming fragment and related metadata in what is called a "chunk." For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/API_dataplane_PutMedia.html">PutMedia</a>. The <code>GetMedia</code> API returns a stream of these chunks starting from the chunk that you specify in the request. The following limits apply when using the <code>GetMedia</code> API: <ul> <li> A client can call <code>GetMedia</code> up to five times per second per stream. </li> <li> Kinesis Video Streams sends media data at a rate of up to 25 megabytes per second (or 200 megabits per second) during a <code>GetMedia</code> session. </li> </ul> <note> If an error is thrown after invoking a Kinesis Video Streams media API, in addition to the HTTP status code and the response body, it includes the following pieces of information: <ul> <li> <code>x-amz-ErrorType</code> HTTP header â€“ contains a more specific error type in addition to what the HTTP status code provides. </li> <li> <code>x-amz-RequestId</code> HTTP header â€“ if you want to report an issue to AWS, the support team can better diagnose the problem if given the Request Id. </li> </ul> Both the HTTP status code and the ErrorType header can be utilized to make programmatic decisions about whether errors are retry-able and under what conditions, as well as provide information on what actions the client programmer might need to take in order to successfully try again. For more information, see the <b>Errors</b> section at the bottom of this topic, as well as <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/CommonErrors.html">Common Errors</a>. </note>

          Gets the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) server configuration information, including URIs, username, and password which can be used to configure the WebRTC connection. The ICE component uses this configuration information to setup the WebRTC connection, including authenticating with the Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) relay server. TURN is a protocol that is used to improve the connectivity of peer-to-peer applications. By providing a cloud-based relay service, TURN ensures that a connection can be established even when one or more peers are incapable of a direct peer-to-peer connection. For more information, see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-uberti-rtcweb-turn-rest-00">A REST API For Access To TURN Services</a>. You can invoke this API to establish a fallback mechanism in case either of the peers is unable to establish a direct peer-to-peer connection over a signaling channel. You must specify either a signaling channel ARN or the client ID in order to invoke this API.

          Describes the specified Kinesis data stream. The information returned includes the stream name, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), creation time, enhanced metric configuration, and shard map. The shard map is an array of shard objects. For each shard object, there is the hash key and sequence number ranges that the shard spans, and the IDs of any earlier shards that played in a role in creating the shard. Every record ingested in the stream is identified by a sequence number, which is assigned when the record is put into the stream. You can limit the number of shards returned by each call. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-retrieve-shards.html">Retrieving Shards from a Stream</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>. There are no guarantees about the chronological order shards returned. To process shards in chronological order, use the ID of the parent shard to track the lineage to the oldest shard. This operation has a limit of 10 transactions per second per account.

          Gets data records from a Kinesis data stream's shard. Specify a shard iterator using the <code>ShardIterator</code> parameter. The shard iterator specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading data records sequentially. If there are no records available in the portion of the shard that the iterator points to, <a>GetRecords</a> returns an empty list. It might take multiple calls to get to a portion of the shard that contains records. You can scale by provisioning multiple shards per stream while considering service limits (for more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html">Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Limits</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>). Your application should have one thread per shard, each reading continuously from its stream. To read from a stream continually, call <a>GetRecords</a> in a loop. Use <a>GetShardIterator</a> to get the shard iterator to specify in the first <a>GetRecords</a> call. <a>GetRecords</a> returns a new shard iterator in <code>NextShardIterator</code>. Specify the shard iterator returned in <code>NextShardIterator</code> in subsequent calls to <a>GetRecords</a>. If the shard has been closed, the shard iterator can't return more data and <a>GetRecords</a> returns <code>null</code> in <code>NextShardIterator</code>. You can terminate the loop when the shard is closed, or when the shard iterator reaches the record with the sequence number or other attribute that marks it as the last record to process. Each data record can be up to 1 MiB in size, and each shard can read up to 2 MiB per second. You can ensure that your calls don't exceed the maximum supported size or throughput by using the <code>Limit</code> parameter to specify the maximum number of records that <a>GetRecords</a> can return. Consider your average record size when determining this limit. The maximum number of records that can be returned per call is 10,000. The size of the data returned by <a>GetRecords</a> varies depending on the utilization of the shard. The maximum size of data that <a>GetRecords</a> can return is 10 MiB. If a call returns this amount of data, subsequent calls made within the next 5 seconds throw <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. If there is insufficient provisioned throughput on the stream, subsequent calls made within the next 1 second throw <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. <a>GetRecords</a> doesn't return any data when it throws an exception. For this reason, we recommend that you wait 1 second between calls to <a>GetRecords</a>. However, it's possible that the application will get exceptions for longer than 1 second. To detect whether the application is falling behind in processing, you can use the <code>MillisBehindLatest</code> response attribute. You can also monitor the stream using CloudWatch metrics and other mechanisms (see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/monitoring.html">Monitoring</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>). Each Amazon Kinesis record includes a value, <code>ApproximateArrivalTimestamp</code>, that is set when a stream successfully receives and stores a record. This is commonly referred to as a server-side time stamp, whereas a client-side time stamp is set when a data producer creates or sends the record to a stream (a data producer is any data source putting data records into a stream, for example with <a>PutRecords</a>). The time stamp has millisecond precision. There are no guarantees about the time stamp accuracy, or that the time stamp is always increasing. For example, records in a shard or across a stream might have time stamps that are out of order. This operation has a limit of five transactions per second per shard.

          Gets an Amazon Kinesis shard iterator. A shard iterator expires 5 minutes after it is returned to the requester. A shard iterator specifies the shard position from which to start reading data records sequentially. The position is specified using the sequence number of a data record in a shard. A sequence number is the identifier associated with every record ingested in the stream, and is assigned when a record is put into the stream. Each stream has one or more shards. You must specify the shard iterator type. For example, you can set the <code>ShardIteratorType</code> parameter to read exactly from the position denoted by a specific sequence number by using the <code>AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER</code> shard iterator type. Alternatively, the parameter can read right after the sequence number by using the <code>AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER</code> shard iterator type, using sequence numbers returned by earlier calls to <a>PutRecord</a>, <a>PutRecords</a>, <a>GetRecords</a>, or <a>DescribeStream</a>. In the request, you can specify the shard iterator type <code>AT_TIMESTAMP</code> to read records from an arbitrary point in time, <code>TRIM_HORIZON</code> to cause <code>ShardIterator</code> to point to the last untrimmed record in the shard in the system (the oldest data record in the shard), or <code>LATEST</code> so that you always read the most recent data in the shard. When you read repeatedly from a stream, use a <a>GetShardIterator</a> request to get the first shard iterator for use in your first <a>GetRecords</a> request and for subsequent reads use the shard iterator returned by the <a>GetRecords</a> request in <code>NextShardIterator</code>. A new shard iterator is returned by every <a>GetRecords</a> request in <code>NextShardIterator</code>, which you use in the <code>ShardIterator</code> parameter of the next <a>GetRecords</a> request. If a <a>GetShardIterator</a> request is made too often, you receive a <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. For more information about throughput limits, see <a>GetRecords</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html">Streams Limits</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>. If the shard is closed, <a>GetShardIterator</a> returns a valid iterator for the last sequence number of the shard. A shard can be closed as a result of using <a>SplitShard</a> or <a>MergeShards</a>. <a>GetShardIterator</a> has a limit of five transactions per second per account per open shard.

          Writes a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis data stream. Call <code>PutRecord</code> to send data into the stream for real-time ingestion and subsequent processing, one record at a time. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MiB per second. You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data; a partition key; and the data blob itself. The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a segment from a log file, geographic/location data, website clickstream data, and so on. The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams to distribute data across shards. Kinesis Data Streams segregates the data records that belong to a stream into multiple shards, using the partition key associated with each data record to determine the shard to which a given data record belongs. Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length limit of 256 characters for each key. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards using the hash key ranges of the shards. You can override hashing the partition key to determine the shard by explicitly specifying a hash value using the <code>ExplicitHashKey</code> parameter. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream">Adding Data to a Stream</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>. <code>PutRecord</code> returns the shard ID of where the data record was placed and the sequence number that was assigned to the data record. Sequence numbers increase over time and are specific to a shard within a stream, not across all shards within a stream. To guarantee strictly increasing ordering, write serially to a shard and use the <code>SequenceNumberForOrdering</code> parameter. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream">Adding Data to a Stream</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>. <important> After you write a record to a stream, you cannot modify that record or its order within the stream. </important> If a <code>PutRecord</code> request cannot be processed because of insufficient provisioned throughput on the shard involved in the request, <code>PutRecord</code> throws <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. By default, data records are accessible for 24 hours from the time that they are added to a stream. You can use <a>IncreaseStreamRetentionPeriod</a> or <a>DecreaseStreamRetentionPeriod</a> to modify this retention period.

          Writes multiple data records into a Kinesis data stream in a single call (also referred to as a <code>PutRecords</code> request). Use this operation to send data into the stream for data ingestion and processing. Each <code>PutRecords</code> request can support up to 500 records. Each record in the request can be as large as 1 MiB, up to a limit of 5 MiB for the entire request, including partition keys. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MiB per second. You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data; and an array of request <code>Records</code>, with each record in the array requiring a partition key and data blob. The record size limit applies to the total size of the partition key and data blob. The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a segment from a log file, geographic/location data, website clickstream data, and so on. The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams as input to a hash function that maps the partition key and associated data to a specific shard. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards. As a result of this hashing mechanism, all data records with the same partition key map to the same shard within the stream. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream">Adding Data to a Stream</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>. Each record in the <code>Records</code> array may include an optional parameter, <code>ExplicitHashKey</code>, which overrides the partition key to shard mapping. This parameter allows a data producer to determine explicitly the shard where the record is stored. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-putrecords">Adding Multiple Records with PutRecords</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>. The <code>PutRecords</code> response includes an array of response <code>Records</code>. Each record in the response array directly correlates with a record in the request array using natural ordering, from the top to the bottom of the request and response. The response <code>Records</code> array always includes the same number of records as the request array. The response <code>Records</code> array includes both successfully and unsuccessfully processed records. Kinesis Data Streams attempts to process all records in each <code>PutRecords</code> request. A single record failure does not stop the processing of subsequent records. As a result, PutRecords doesn't guarantee the ordering of records. If you need to read records in the same order they are written to the stream, use <a>PutRecord</a> instead of <code>PutRecords</code>, and write to the same shard. A successfully processed record includes <code>ShardId</code> and <code>SequenceNumber</code> values. The <code>ShardId</code> parameter identifies the shard in the stream where the record is stored. The <code>SequenceNumber</code> parameter is an identifier assigned to the put record, unique to all records in the stream. An unsuccessfully processed record includes <code>ErrorCode</code> and <code>ErrorMessage</code> values. <code>ErrorCode</code> reflects the type of error and can be one of the following values: <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code> or <code>InternalFailure</code>. <code>ErrorMessage</code> provides more detailed information about the <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code> exception including the account ID, stream name, and shard ID of the record that was throttled. For more information about partially successful responses, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-putrecords">Adding Multiple Records with PutRecords</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>. <important> After you write a record to a stream, you cannot modify that record or its order within the stream. </important> By default, data records are accessible for 24 hours from the time that they are added to a stream.

          This operation establishes an HTTP/2 connection between the consumer you specify in the <code>ConsumerARN</code> parameter and the shard you specify in the <code>ShardId</code> parameter. After the connection is successfully established, Kinesis Data Streams pushes records from the shard to the consumer over this connection. Before you call this operation, call <a>RegisterStreamConsumer</a> to register the consumer with Kinesis Data Streams. When the <code>SubscribeToShard</code> call succeeds, your consumer starts receiving events of type <a>SubscribeToShardEvent</a> over the HTTP/2 connection for up to 5 minutes, after which time you need to call <code>SubscribeToShard</code> again to renew the subscription if you want to continue to receive records. You can make one call to <code>SubscribeToShard</code> per second per registered consumer per shard. For example, if you have a 4000 shard stream and two registered stream consumers, you can make one <code>SubscribeToShard</code> request per second for each combination of shard and registered consumer, allowing you to subscribe both consumers to all 4000 shards in one second. If you call <code>SubscribeToShard</code> again with the same <code>ConsumerARN</code> and <code>ShardId</code> within 5 seconds of a successful call, you'll get a <code>ResourceInUseException</code>. If you call <code>SubscribeToShard</code> 5 seconds or more after a successful call, the first connection will expire and the second call will take over the subscription.

          <note> This documentation is for version 1 of the Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API, which only supports SQL applications. Version 2 of the API supports SQL and Java applications. For more information about version 2, see <a href="/kinesisanalytics/latest/apiv2/Welcome.html">Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics API V2 Documentation</a>. </note> Creates an Amazon Kinesis Analytics application. You can configure each application with one streaming source as input, application code to process the input, and up to three destinations where you want Amazon Kinesis Analytics to write the output data from your application. For an overview, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/how-it-works.html">How it Works</a>. In the input configuration, you map the streaming source to an in-application stream, which you can think of as a constantly updating table. In the mapping, you must provide a schema for the in-application stream and map each data column in the in-application stream to a data element in the streaming source. Your application code is one or more SQL statements that read input data, transform it, and generate output. Your application code can create one or more SQL artifacts like SQL streams or pumps. In the output configuration, you can configure the application to write data from in-application streams created in your applications to up to three destinations. To read data from your source stream or write data to destination streams, Amazon Kinesis Analytics needs your permissions. You grant these permissions by creating IAM roles. This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>kinesisanalytics:CreateApplication</code> action. For introductory exercises to create an Amazon Kinesis Analytics application, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/getting-started.html">Getting Started</a>.

          Adds an external destination to your SQL-based Kinesis Data Analytics application. If you want Kinesis Data Analytics to deliver data from an in-application stream within your application to an external destination (such as an Kinesis data stream, a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream, or an Amazon Lambda function), you add the relevant configuration to your application using this operation. You can configure one or more outputs for your application. Each output configuration maps an in-application stream and an external destination. You can use one of the output configurations to deliver data from your in-application error stream to an external destination so that you can analyze the errors. Any configuration update, including adding a streaming source using this operation, results in a new version of the application. You can use the <a>DescribeApplication</a> operation to find the current application version.

          Creates and returns a URL that you can use to connect to an application's extension. Currently, the only available extension is the Apache Flink dashboard. The IAM role or user used to call this API defines the permissions to access the extension. After the presigned URL is created, no additional permission is required to access this URL. IAM authorization policies for this API are also enforced for every HTTP request that attempts to connect to the extension. You control the amount of time that the URL will be valid using the <code>SessionExpirationDurationInSeconds</code> parameter. If you do not provide this parameter, the returned URL is valid for twelve hours. <note> The URL that you get from a call to CreateApplicationPresignedUrl must be used within 3 minutes to be valid.

          Provides an endpoint for the specified signaling channel to send and receive messages. This API uses the <code>SingleMasterChannelEndpointConfiguration</code> input parameter, which consists of the <code>Protocols</code> and <code>Role</code> properties. <code>Protocols</code> is used to determine the communication mechanism. For example, if you specify <code>WSS</code> as the protocol, this API produces a secure websocket endpoint. If you specify <code>HTTPS</code> as the protocol, this API generates an HTTPS endpoint. <code>Role</code> determines the messaging permissions. A <code>MASTER</code> role results in this API generating an endpoint that a client can use to communicate with any of the viewers on the channel.

The custom key store must be connected before you can create KMS keys in the key store or use the KMS keys it contains. You can disconnect and reconnect a custom key store at any time. To connect a custom key store, its associated CloudHSM cluster must have at least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a cluster, use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeClusters.html">DescribeClusters</a> operation. To add HSMs to the cluster, use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_CreateHsm.html">CreateHsm</a> operation. Also, the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-concepts.html#concept-kmsuser"> <code>kmsuser</code> crypto user</a> (CU) must not be logged into the cluster. This prevents KMS from using this account to log in. The connection process can take an extended amount of time to complete; up to 20 minutes. This operation starts the connection process, but it does not wait for it to complete. When it succeeds, this operation quickly returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties. However, this response does not indicate that the custom key store is connected. To get the connection state of the custom key store, use the <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> operation. During the connection process, KMS finds the CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store, creates the connection infrastructure, connects to the cluster, logs into the CloudHSM client as the <code>kmsuser</code> CU, and rotates its password. The <code>ConnectCustomKeyStore</code> operation might fail for various reasons. To find the reason, use the <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> operation and see the <code>ConnectionErrorCode</code> in the response. For help interpreting the <code>ConnectionErrorCode</code>, see <a>CustomKeyStoresListEntry</a>. To fix the failure, use the <a>DisconnectCustomKeyStore</a> operation to disconnect the custom key store, correct the error, use the <a>UpdateCustomKeyStore</a> operation if necessary, and then use <code>ConnectCustomKeyStore</code> again. If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting a custom key store, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html">Troubleshooting a Custom Key Store</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>. <b>Cross-account use</b>: No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account. <b>Required permissions</b>: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html">kms:ConnectCustomKeyStore</a> (IAM policy) <b>Related operations</b> <ul> <li> <a>CreateCustomKeyStore</a> </li> <li> <a>DeleteCustomKeyStore</a> </li> <li> <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> </li> <li> <a>DisconnectCustomKeyStore</a> </li> <li> <a>UpdateCustomKeyStore</a> </li> </ul>

          Adds a grant to a KMS key. A <i>grant</i> is a policy instrument that allows Amazon Web Services principals to use KMS keys in cryptographic operations. It also can allow them to view a KMS key (<a>DescribeKey</a>) and create and manage grants. When authorizing access to a KMS key, grants are considered along with key policies and IAM policies. Grants are often used for temporary permissions because you can create one, use its permissions, and delete it without changing your key policies or IAM policies. For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html">Using grants</a> in the <i> <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i> </i>. For examples of working with grants in several programming languages, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/programming-grants.html">Programming grants</a>. The <code>CreateGrant</code> operation returns a <code>GrantToken</code> and a <code>GrantId</code>. <ul> <li> When you create, retire, or revoke a grant, there might be a brief delay, usually less than five minutes, until the grant is available throughout KMS. This state is known as <i>eventual consistency</i>. Once the grant has achieved eventual consistency, the grantee principal can use the permissions in the grant without identifying the grant. However, to use the permissions in the grant immediately, use the <code>GrantToken</code> that <code>CreateGrant</code> returns. For details, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grant-manage.html#using-grant-token">Using a grant token</a> in the <i> <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i> </i>. </li> <li> The <code>CreateGrant</code> operation also returns a <code>GrantId</code>.

The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, KMS is keeping some variations of this term. </note> You can use the <code>CreateKey</code> operation to create symmetric or asymmetric KMS keys. <ul> <li> <b>Symmetric KMS keys</b> contain a 256-bit symmetric key that never leaves KMS unencrypted. To use the KMS key, you must call KMS. You can use a symmetric KMS key to encrypt and decrypt small amounts of data, but they are typically used to generate <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#data-keys">data keys</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#data-key-pairs">data keys pairs</a>. For details, see <a>GenerateDataKey</a> and <a>GenerateDataKeyPair</a>. </li> <li> <b>Asymmetric KMS keys</b> can contain an RSA key pair or an Elliptic Curve (ECC) key pair. The private key in an asymmetric KMS key never leaves KMS unencrypted. However, you can use the <a>GetPublicKey</a> operation to download the public key so it can be used outside of KMS. KMS keys with RSA key pairs can be used to encrypt or decrypt data or sign and verify messages (but not both). KMS keys with ECC key pairs can be used only to sign and verify messages. </li> </ul> For information about symmetric and asymmetric KMS keys, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html">Using Symmetric and Asymmetric KMS keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>. To create different types of KMS keys, use the following guidance: <dl> <dt>Asymmetric KMS keys</dt> <dd> To create an asymmetric KMS key, use the <code>KeySpec</code> parameter to specify the type of key material in the KMS key. Then, use the <code>KeyUsage</code> parameter to determine whether the KMS key will be used to encrypt and decrypt or sign and verify. You can't change these properties after the KMS key is created. </dd> <dt>Symmetric KMS keys</dt> <dd> When creating a symmetric KMS key, you don't need to specify the <code>KeySpec</code> or <code>KeyUsage</code> parameters. The default value for <code>KeySpec</code>, <code>SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT</code>, and the default value for <code>KeyUsage</code>, <code>ENCRYPT_DECRYPT</code>, are the only valid values for symmetric KMS keys. </dd> <dt>Multi-Region primary keys</dt> <dt>Imported key material</dt> <dd> To create a multi-Region <i>primary key</i> in the local Amazon Web Services Region, use the <code>MultiRegion</code> parameter with a value of <code>True</code>. To create a multi-Region <i>replica key</i>, that is, a KMS key with the same key ID and key material as a primary key, but in a different Amazon Web Services Region, use the <a>ReplicateKey</a> operation. To change a replica key to a primary key, and its primary key to a replica key, use the <a>UpdatePrimaryRegion</a> operation. This operation supports <i>multi-Region keys</i>, an KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region keys, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html">Using multi-Region keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>. You can create symmetric and asymmetric multi-Region keys and multi-Region keys with imported key material. You cannot create multi-Region keys in a custom key store. </dd> <dd> To import your own key material, begin by creating a symmetric KMS key with no key material.

When the KMS key is asymmetric, you must specify the KMS key and the encryption algorithm that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. For information about symmetric and asymmetric KMS keys, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html">Using Symmetric and Asymmetric KMS keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>. The Decrypt operation also decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted outside of KMS by the public key in an KMS asymmetric KMS key. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/">Amazon Web Services Encryption SDK</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html">Amazon S3 client-side encryption</a>. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with KMS. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric KMS key, the <code>KeyId</code> parameter is optional. KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if they've lost track of the key ID. However, specifying the KMS key is always recommended as a best practice. When you use the <code>KeyId</code> parameter to specify a KMS key, KMS only uses the KMS key you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different KMS key, the <code>Decrypt</code> operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend. Whenever possible, use key policies to give users permission to call the <code>Decrypt</code> operation on a particular KMS key, instead of using IAM policies. Otherwise, you might create an IAM user policy that gives the user <code>Decrypt</code> permission on all KMS keys. This user could decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by KMS keys in other accounts if the key policy for the cross-account KMS key permits it. If you must use an IAM policy for <code>Decrypt</code> permissions, limit the user to particular KMS keys or particular trusted accounts.

          Generates a unique asymmetric data key pair. The <code>GenerateDataKeyPair</code> operation returns a plaintext public key, a plaintext private key, and a copy of the private key that is encrypted under the symmetric KMS key you specify. You can use the data key pair to perform asymmetric cryptography and implement digital signatures outside of KMS. You can use the public key that <code>GenerateDataKeyPair</code> returns to encrypt data or verify a signature outside of KMS. Then, store the encrypted private key with the data. When you are ready to decrypt data or sign a message, you can use the <a>Decrypt</a> operation to decrypt the encrypted private key. To generate a data key pair, you must specify a symmetric KMS key to encrypt the private key in a data key pair. You cannot use an asymmetric KMS key or a KMS key in a custom key store. To get the type and origin of your KMS key, use the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation. Use the <code>KeyPairSpec</code> parameter to choose an RSA or Elliptic Curve (ECC) data key pair. KMS recommends that your use ECC key pairs for signing, and use RSA key pairs for either encryption or signing, but not both. However, KMS cannot enforce any restrictions on the use of data key pairs outside of KMS. If you are using the data key pair to encrypt data, or for any operation where you don't immediately need a private key, consider using the <a>GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext</a> operation. <code>GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext</code> returns a plaintext public key and an encrypted private key, but omits the plaintext private key that you need only to decrypt ciphertext or sign a message. Later, when you need to decrypt the data or sign a message, use the <a>Decrypt</a> operation to decrypt the encrypted private key in the data key pair. <code>GenerateDataKeyPair</code> returns a unique data key pair for each request.

          Generates a unique asymmetric data key pair. The <code>GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext</code> operation returns a plaintext public key and a copy of the private key that is encrypted under the symmetric KMS key you specify. Unlike <a>GenerateDataKeyPair</a>, this operation does not return a plaintext private key. You can use the public key that <code>GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext</code> returns to encrypt data or verify a signature outside of KMS. Then, store the encrypted private key with the data. When you are ready to decrypt data or sign a message, you can use the <a>Decrypt</a> operation to decrypt the encrypted private key. To generate a data key pair, you must specify a symmetric KMS key to encrypt the private key in a data key pair. You cannot use an asymmetric KMS key or a KMS key in a custom key store. To get the type and origin of your KMS key, use the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation. Use the <code>KeyPairSpec</code> parameter to choose an RSA or Elliptic Curve (ECC) data key pair. KMS recommends that your use ECC key pairs for signing, and use RSA key pairs for either encryption or signing, but not both. However, KMS cannot enforce any restrictions on the use of data key pairs outside of KMS. <code>GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext</code> returns a unique data key pair for each request.

          Generates a unique symmetric data key. This operation returns a data key that is encrypted under a KMS key that you specify. To request an asymmetric data key pair, use the <a>GenerateDataKeyPair</a> or <a>GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext</a> operations. <code>GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext</code> is identical to the <a>GenerateDataKey</a> operation except that returns only the encrypted copy of the data key. This operation is useful for systems that need to encrypt data at some point, but not immediately. When you need to encrypt the data, you call the <a>Decrypt</a> operation on the encrypted copy of the key. It's also useful in distributed systems with different levels of trust. For example, you might store encrypted data in containers. One component of your system creates new containers and stores an encrypted data key with each container. Then, a different component puts the data into the containers. That component first decrypts the data key, uses the plaintext data key to encrypt data, puts the encrypted data into the container, and then destroys the plaintext data key. In this system, the component that creates the containers never sees the plaintext data key. <code>GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext</code> returns a unique data key for each request. The bytes in the keys are not related to the caller or KMS key that is used to encrypt the private key. To generate a data key, you must specify the symmetric KMS key that is used to encrypt the data key. You cannot use an asymmetric KMS key to generate a data key. To get the type of your KMS key, use the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation. If the operation succeeds, you will find the encrypted copy of the data key in the <code>CiphertextBlob</code> field. You can use the optional encryption context to add additional security to the encryption operation. If you specify an <code>EncryptionContext</code>, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the encrypted data key.

          Returns the public key of an asymmetric KMS key. Unlike the private key of a asymmetric KMS key, which never leaves KMS unencrypted, callers with <code>kms:GetPublicKey</code> permission can download the public key of an asymmetric KMS key. You can share the public key to allow others to encrypt messages and verify signatures outside of KMS. For information about symmetric and asymmetric KMS keys, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html">Using Symmetric and Asymmetric KMS keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>. You do not need to download the public key. Instead, you can use the public key within KMS by calling the <a>Encrypt</a>, <a>ReEncrypt</a>, or <a>Verify</a> operations with the identifier of an asymmetric KMS key. When you use the public key within KMS, you benefit from the authentication, authorization, and logging that are part of every KMS operation. You also reduce of risk of encrypting data that cannot be decrypted. These features are not effective outside of KMS. For details, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/download-public-key.html#download-public-key-considerations">Special Considerations for Downloading Public Keys</a>. To help you use the public key safely outside of KMS, <code>GetPublicKey</code> returns important information about the public key in the response, including: <ul> <li> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-KeySpec">KeySpec</a>: The type of key material in the public key, such as <code>RSA_4096</code> or <code>ECC_NIST_P521</code>. </li> <li> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-KeyUsage">KeyUsage</a>: Whether the key is used for encryption or signing. </li> <li> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-EncryptionAlgorithms">EncryptionAlgorithms</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-SigningAlgorithms">SigningAlgorithms</a>: A list of the encryption algorithms or the signing algorithms for the key. </li> </ul> Although KMS cannot enforce these restrictions on external operations, it is crucial that you use this information to prevent the public key from being used improperly. For example, you can prevent a public signing key from being used encrypt data, or prevent a public key from being used with an encryption algorithm that is not supported by KMS. You can also avoid errors, such as using the wrong signing algorithm in a verification operation. The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.

          Decrypts ciphertext and then reencrypts it entirely within KMS. You can use this operation to change the KMS key under which data is encrypted, such as when you <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html#rotate-keys-manually">manually rotate</a> a KMS key or change the KMS key that protects a ciphertext. You can also use it to reencrypt ciphertext under the same KMS key, such as to change the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context">encryption context</a> of a ciphertext. The <code>ReEncrypt</code> operation can decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using an KMS KMS key in an KMS operation, such as <a>Encrypt</a> or <a>GenerateDataKey</a>. It can also decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using the public key of an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symm-asymm-concepts.html#asymmetric-cmks">asymmetric KMS key</a> outside of KMS. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/">Amazon Web Services Encryption SDK</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html">Amazon S3 client-side encryption</a>. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with KMS. When you use the <code>ReEncrypt</code> operation, you need to provide information for the decrypt operation and the subsequent encrypt operation. <ul> <li> If your ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric KMS key, you must use the <code>SourceKeyId</code> parameter to identify the KMS key that encrypted the ciphertext. You must also supply the encryption algorithm that was used. This information is required to decrypt the data. </li> <li> If your ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric KMS key, the <code>SourceKeyId</code> parameter is optional. KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if they've lost track of the key ID. However, specifying the source KMS key is always recommended as a best practice. When you use the <code>SourceKeyId</code> parameter to specify a KMS key, KMS uses only the KMS key you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different KMS key, the <code>ReEncrypt</code> operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend. </li> <li> To reencrypt the data, you must use the <code>DestinationKeyId</code> parameter specify the KMS key that re-encrypts the data after it is decrypted. You can select a symmetric or asymmetric KMS key. If the destination KMS key is an asymmetric KMS key, you must also provide the encryption algorithm. The algorithm that you choose must be compatible with the KMS key. <important> When you use an asymmetric KMS key to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the KMS key and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the same KMS key and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the KMS key and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails. You are not required to supply the key ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt with symmetric KMS keys because KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob. KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields. </important> </li> </ul> The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html">Key state: Effect on your KMS key</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>. <b>Cross-account use</b>: Yes. The source KMS key and destination KMS key can be in different Amazon Web Services accounts. Either or both KMS keys can be in a different account than the caller. To specify a KMS key in a different account, you must use its key ARN or alias ARN. <b>Required permissions</b>: <ul> <li> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html">kms:ReEncryptFrom</a> permission on the source KMS key (key policy) </li> <li> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html">kms:ReEncryptTo</a> permission on the destination KMS key (key policy) </li> </ul> To permit reencryption from or to a KMS key, include the <code>"kms:ReEncrypt*"</code> permission in your <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html">key policy</a>.

          Replicates a multi-Region key into the specified Region. This operation creates a multi-Region replica key based on a multi-Region primary key in a different Region of the same Amazon Web Services partition. You can create multiple replicas of a primary key, but each must be in a different Region. To create a multi-Region primary key, use the <a>CreateKey</a> operation. This operation supports <i>multi-Region keys</i>, an KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region keys, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html">Using multi-Region keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>. A <i>replica key</i> is a fully-functional KMS key that can be used independently of its primary and peer replica keys. A primary key and its replica keys share properties that make them interoperable. They have the same <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id-key-id">key ID</a> and key material. They also have the same <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-spec">key spec</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-usage">key usage</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-origin">key material origin</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html">automatic key rotation status</a>. KMS automatically synchronizes these shared properties among related multi-Region keys. All other properties of a replica key can differ, including its <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html">key policy</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/tagging-keys.html">tags</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-alias.html">aliases</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html">key state</a>. KMS pricing and quotas for KMS keys apply to each primary key and replica key. When this operation completes, the new replica key has a transient key state of <code>Creating</code>. This key state changes to <code>Enabled</code> (or <code>PendingImport</code>) after a few seconds when the process of creating the new replica key is complete. While the key state is <code>Creating</code>, you can manage key, but you cannot yet use it in cryptographic operations. If you are creating and using the replica key programmatically, retry on <code>KMSInvalidStateException</code> or call <code>DescribeKey</code> to check its <code>KeyState</code> value before using it. For details about the <code>Creating</code> key state, see <a href="kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html">Key state: Effect on your KMS key</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>. The CloudTrail log of a <code>ReplicateKey</code> operation records a <code>ReplicateKey</code> operation in the primary key's Region and a <a>CreateKey</a> operation in the replica key's Region. If you replicate a multi-Region primary key with imported key material, the replica key is created with no key material. You must import the same key material that you imported into the primary key. For details, see <a href="kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-import.html">Importing key material into multi-Region keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>. To convert a replica key to a primary key, use the <a>UpdatePrimaryRegion</a> operation. <note> <code>ReplicateKey</code> uses different default values for the <code>KeyPolicy</code> and <code>Tags</code> parameters than those used in the KMS console. For details, see the parameter descriptions. </note> <b>Cross-account use</b>: No. You cannot use this operation to create a replica key in a different Amazon Web Services account. <b>Required permissions</b>: <ul> <li> <code>kms:ReplicateKey</code> on the primary key (in the primary key's Region).

          Schedules the deletion of a KMS key. By default, KMS applies a waiting period of 30 days, but you can specify a waiting period of 7-30 days. When this operation is successful, the key state of the KMS key changes to <code>PendingDeletion</code> and the key can't be used in any cryptographic operations. It remains in this state for the duration of the waiting period. Before the waiting period ends, you can use <a>CancelKeyDeletion</a> to cancel the deletion of the KMS key. After the waiting period ends, KMS deletes the KMS key, its key material, and all KMS data associated with it, including all aliases that refer to it. <important> Deleting a KMS key is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation. When a KMS key is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the KMS key is unrecoverable. (The only exception is a multi-Region replica key.) To prevent the use of a KMS key without deleting it, use <a>DisableKey</a>. </important> If you schedule deletion of a KMS key from a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html">custom key store</a>, when the waiting period expires, <code>ScheduleKeyDeletion</code> deletes the KMS key from KMS. Then KMS makes a best effort to delete the key material from the associated CloudHSM cluster. However, you might need to manually <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-orphaned-key">delete the orphaned key material</a> from the cluster and its backups. You can schedule the deletion of a multi-Region primary key and its replica keys at any time. However, KMS will not delete a multi-Region primary key with existing replica keys. If you schedule the deletion of a primary key with replicas, its key state changes to <code>PendingReplicaDeletion</code> and it cannot be replicated or used in cryptographic operations. This status can continue indefinitely. When the last of its replicas keys is deleted (not just scheduled), the key state of the primary key changes to <code>PendingDeletion</code> and its waiting period (<code>PendingWindowInDays</code>) begins.

To verify the signature, use the <a>Verify</a> operation, or use the public key in the same asymmetric KMS key outside of KMS. For information about symmetric and asymmetric KMS keys, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html">Using Symmetric and Asymmetric KMS keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>. Digital signatures are generated and verified by using asymmetric key pair, such as an RSA or ECC pair that is represented by an asymmetric KMS key. The key owner (or an authorized user) uses their private key to sign a message. Anyone with the public key can verify that the message was signed with that particular private key and that the message hasn't changed since it was signed. To use the <code>Sign</code> operation, provide the following information: <ul> <li> Use the <code>KeyId</code> parameter to identify an asymmetric KMS key with a <code>KeyUsage</code> value of <code>SIGN_VERIFY</code>.

          Registers the resource as managed by the Data Catalog. To add or update data, Lake Formation needs read/write access to the chosen Amazon S3 path. Choose a role that you know has permission to do this, or choose the AWSServiceRoleForLakeFormationDataAccess service-linked role. When you register the first Amazon S3 path, the service-linked role and a new inline policy are created on your behalf. Lake Formation adds the first path to the inline policy and attaches it to the service-linked role. When you register subsequent paths, Lake Formation adds the path to the existing policy. The following request registers a new location and gives AWS Lake Formation permission to use the service-linked role to access that location. <code>ResourceArn = arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket UseServiceLinkedRole = true</code> If <code>UseServiceLinkedRole</code> is not set to true, you must provide or set the <code>RoleArn</code>: <code>arn:aws:iam::12345:role/my-data-access-role</code>

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Grants an Amazon Web Services service or another account permission to use a function. You can apply the policy at the function level, or specify a qualifier to restrict access to a single version or alias. If you use a qualifier, the invoker must use the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of that version or alias to invoke the function. Note: Lambda does not support adding policies to version $LATEST. To grant permission to another account, specify the account ID as the <code>Principal</code>. For Amazon Web Services services, the principal is a domain-style identifier defined by the service, like <code>s3.amazonaws.com</code> or <code>sns.amazonaws.com</code>. For Amazon Web Services services, you can also specify the ARN of the associated resource as the <code>SourceArn</code>. If you grant permission to a service principal without specifying the source, other accounts could potentially configure resources in their account to invoke your Lambda function. This action adds a statement to a resource-based permissions policy for the function. For more information about function policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/access-control-resource-based.html">Lambda Function Policies</a>.

        <details>
          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Creates a Lambda function. To create a function, you need a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html">deployment package</a> and an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-permission-model.html#lambda-intro-execution-role">execution role</a>. The deployment package is a .zip file archive or container image that contains your function code. The execution role grants the function permission to use Amazon Web Services services, such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log streaming and X-Ray for request tracing. You set the package type to <code>Image</code> if the deployment package is a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-images.html">container image</a>. For a container image, the code property must include the URI of a container image in the Amazon ECR registry. You do not need to specify the handler and runtime properties. You set the package type to <code>Zip</code> if the deployment package is a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html#gettingstarted-package-zip">.zip file archive</a>. For a .zip file archive, the code property specifies the location of the .zip file. You must also specify the handler and runtime properties. The code in the deployment package must be compatible with the target instruction set architecture of the function (<code>x86-64</code> or <code>arm64</code>). If you do not specify the architecture, the default value is <code>x86-64</code>. When you create a function, Lambda provisions an instance of the function and its supporting resources. If your function connects to a VPC, this process can take a minute or so. During this time, you can't invoke or modify the function. The <code>State</code>, <code>StateReason</code>, and <code>StateReasonCode</code> fields in the response from <a>GetFunctionConfiguration</a> indicate when the function is ready to invoke. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/functions-states.html">Function States</a>. A function has an unpublished version, and can have published versions and aliases. The unpublished version changes when you update your function's code and configuration. A published version is a snapshot of your function code and configuration that can't be changed. An alias is a named resource that maps to a version, and can be changed to map to a different version. Use the <code>Publish</code> parameter to create version <code>1</code> of your function from its initial configuration. The other parameters let you configure version-specific and function-level settings. You can modify version-specific settings later with <a>UpdateFunctionConfiguration</a>. Function-level settings apply to both the unpublished and published versions of the function, and include tags (<a>TagResource</a>) and per-function concurrency limits (<a>PutFunctionConcurrency</a>). You can use code signing if your deployment package is a .zip file archive. To enable code signing for this function, specify the ARN of a code-signing configuration. When a user attempts to deploy a code package with <a>UpdateFunctionCode</a>, Lambda checks that the code package has a valid signature from a trusted publisher. The code-signing configuration includes set set of signing profiles, which define the trusted publishers for this function. If another account or an Amazon Web Services service invokes your function, use <a>AddPermission</a> to grant permission by creating a resource-based IAM policy. You can grant permissions at the function level, on a version, or on an alias. To invoke your function directly, use <a>Invoke</a>. To invoke your function in response to events in other Amazon Web Services services, create an event source mapping (<a>CreateEventSourceMapping</a>), or configure a function trigger in the other service. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-invocation.html">Invoking Functions</a>.

          Invokes a Lambda function. You can invoke a function synchronously (and wait for the response), or asynchronously. To invoke a function asynchronously, set <code>InvocationType</code> to <code>Event</code>. For <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-sync.html">synchronous invocation</a>, details about the function response, including errors, are included in the response body and headers. For either invocation type, you can find more information in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-functions.html">execution log</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-x-ray.html">trace</a>. When an error occurs, your function may be invoked multiple times. Retry behavior varies by error type, client, event source, and invocation type. For example, if you invoke a function asynchronously and it returns an error, Lambda executes the function up to two more times. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/retries-on-errors.html">Retry Behavior</a>. For <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html">asynchronous invocation</a>, Lambda adds events to a queue before sending them to your function. If your function does not have enough capacity to keep up with the queue, events may be lost. Occasionally, your function may receive the same event multiple times, even if no error occurs. To retain events that were not processed, configure your function with a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#dlq">dead-letter queue</a>. The status code in the API response doesn't reflect function errors. Error codes are reserved for errors that prevent your function from executing, such as permissions errors, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html">limit errors</a>, or issues with your function's code and configuration. For example, Lambda returns <code>TooManyRequestsException</code> if executing the function would cause you to exceed a concurrency limit at either the account level (<code>ConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded</code>) or function level (<code>ReservedFunctionConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded</code>). For functions with a long timeout, your client might be disconnected during synchronous invocation while it waits for a response. Configure your HTTP client, SDK, firewall, proxy, or operating system to allow for long connections with timeout or keep-alive settings. This operation requires permission for the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_awslambda.html">lambda:InvokeFunction</a> action.

          Sets the maximum number of simultaneous executions for a function, and reserves capacity for that concurrency level. Concurrency settings apply to the function as a whole, including all published versions and the unpublished version. Reserving concurrency both ensures that your function has capacity to process the specified number of events simultaneously, and prevents it from scaling beyond that level. Use <a>GetFunction</a> to see the current setting for a function. Use <a>GetAccountSettings</a> to see your Regional concurrency limit. You can reserve concurrency for as many functions as you like, as long as you leave at least 100 simultaneous executions unreserved for functions that aren't configured with a per-function limit.

          Configures options for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html">asynchronous invocation</a> on a function, version, or alias. If a configuration already exists for a function, version, or alias, this operation overwrites it. If you exclude any settings, they are removed. To set one option without affecting existing settings for other options, use <a>UpdateFunctionEventInvokeConfig</a>. By default, Lambda retries an asynchronous invocation twice if the function returns an error. It retains events in a queue for up to six hours. When an event fails all processing attempts or stays in the asynchronous invocation queue for too long, Lambda discards it. To retain discarded events, configure a dead-letter queue with <a>UpdateFunctionConfiguration</a>. To send an invocation record to a queue, topic, function, or event bus, specify a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#invocation-async-destinations">destination</a>. You can configure separate destinations for successful invocations (on-success) and events that fail all processing attempts (on-failure). You can configure destinations in addition to or instead of a dead-letter queue.

          Modify the version-specific settings of a Lambda function. When you update a function, Lambda provisions an instance of the function and its supporting resources. If your function connects to a VPC, this process can take a minute. During this time, you can't modify the function, but you can still invoke it. The <code>LastUpdateStatus</code>, <code>LastUpdateStatusReason</code>, and <code>LastUpdateStatusReasonCode</code> fields in the response from <a>GetFunctionConfiguration</a> indicate when the update is complete and the function is processing events with the new configuration. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/functions-states.html">Function States</a>. These settings can vary between versions of a function and are locked when you publish a version. You can't modify the configuration of a published version, only the unpublished version. To configure function concurrency, use <a>PutFunctionConcurrency</a>. To grant invoke permissions to an account or Amazon Web Services service, use <a>AddPermission</a>.

You can use this list to tune the utterances that your bot responds to. For example, say that you have created a bot to order flowers. After your users have used your bot for a while, use the <code>GetUtterancesView</code> operation to see the requests that they have made and whether they have been successful. You might find that the utterance "I want flowers" is not being recognized. You could add this utterance to the <code>OrderFlowers</code> intent so that your bot recognizes that utterance. After you publish a new version of a bot, you can get information about the old version and the new so that you can compare the performance across the two versions. Utterance statistics are generated once a day. Data is available for the last 15 days. You can request information for up to 5 versions of your bot in each request. Amazon Lex returns the most frequent utterances received by the bot in the last 15 days. The response contains information about a maximum of 100 utterances for each version. If you set <code>childDirected</code> field to true when you created your bot, if you are using slot obfuscation with one or more slots, or if you opted out of participating in improving Amazon Lex, utterances are not available. This operation requires permissions for the <code>lex:GetUtterancesView</code> action.

          Sends user input (text or speech) to Amazon Lex. Clients use this API to send text and audio requests to Amazon Lex at runtime. Amazon Lex interprets the user input using the machine learning model that it built for the bot. The <code>PostContent</code> operation supports audio input at 8kHz and 16kHz. You can use 8kHz audio to achieve higher speech recognition accuracy in telephone audio applications. In response, Amazon Lex returns the next message to convey to the user. Consider the following example messages: <ul> <li> For a user input "I would like a pizza," Amazon Lex might return a response with a message eliciting slot data (for example, <code>PizzaSize</code>): "What size pizza would you like?". </li> <li> After the user provides all of the pizza order information, Amazon Lex might return a response with a message to get user confirmation: "Order the pizza?". </li> <li> After the user replies "Yes" to the confirmation prompt, Amazon Lex might return a conclusion statement: "Thank you, your cheese pizza has been ordered.". </li> </ul> Not all Amazon Lex messages require a response from the user. For example, conclusion statements do not require a response. Some messages require only a yes or no response. In addition to the <code>message</code>, Amazon Lex provides additional context about the message in the response that you can use to enhance client behavior, such as displaying the appropriate client user interface. Consider the following examples: <ul> <li> If the message is to elicit slot data, Amazon Lex returns the following context information: <ul> <li> <code>x-amz-lex-dialog-state</code> header set to <code>ElicitSlot</code> </li> <li> <code>x-amz-lex-intent-name</code> header set to the intent name in the current context </li> <li> <code>x-amz-lex-slot-to-elicit</code> header set to the slot name for which the <code>message</code> is eliciting information </li> <li> <code>x-amz-lex-slots</code> header set to a map of slots configured for the intent with their current values </li> </ul> </li> <li> If the message is a confirmation prompt, the <code>x-amz-lex-dialog-state</code> header is set to <code>Confirmation</code> and the <code>x-amz-lex-slot-to-elicit</code> header is omitted. </li> <li> If the message is a clarification prompt configured for the intent, indicating that the user intent is not understood, the <code>x-amz-dialog-state</code> header is set to <code>ElicitIntent</code> and the <code>x-amz-slot-to-elicit</code> header is omitted. </li> </ul> In addition, Amazon Lex also returns your application-specific <code>sessionAttributes</code>.

Amazon Lex then interprets the user input using the machine learning model it built for the bot.

Consider the following example messages: <ul> <li> For a user input "I would like a pizza", Amazon Lex might return a response with a message eliciting slot data (for example, PizzaSize): "What size pizza would you like?" </li> <li> After the user provides all of the pizza order information, Amazon Lex might return a response with a message to obtain user confirmation "Proceed with the pizza order?". </li> <li> After the user replies to a confirmation prompt with a "yes", Amazon Lex might return a conclusion statement: "Thank you, your cheese pizza has been ordered.". </li> </ul> Not all Amazon Lex messages require a user response. For example, a conclusion statement does not require a response. Some messages require only a "yes" or "no" user response. In addition to the <code>message</code>, Amazon Lex provides additional context about the message in the response that you might use to enhance client behavior, for example, to display the appropriate client user interface. These are the <code>slotToElicit</code>, <code>dialogState</code>, <code>intentName</code>, and <code>slots</code> fields in the response. Consider the following examples: <ul> <li> If the message is to elicit slot data, Amazon Lex returns the following context information: <ul> <li> <code>dialogState</code> set to ElicitSlot </li> <li> <code>intentName</code> set to the intent name in the current context </li> <li> <code>slotToElicit</code> set to the slot name for which the <code>message</code> is eliciting information </li> <li> <code>slots</code> set to a map of slots, configured for the intent, with currently known values </li> </ul> </li> <li> If the message is a confirmation prompt, the <code>dialogState</code> is set to ConfirmIntent and <code>SlotToElicit</code> is set to null. </li> <li> If the message is a clarification prompt (configured for the intent) that indicates that user intent is not understood, the <code>dialogState</code> is set to ElicitIntent and <code>slotToElicit</code> is set to null. </li> </ul> In addition, Amazon Lex also returns your application-specific <code>sessionAttributes</code>.

          Provides a list of utterances that users have sent to the bot. Utterances are aggregated by the text of the utterance. For example, all instances where customers used the phrase "I want to order pizza" are aggregated into the same line in the response. You can see both detected utterances and missed utterances. A detected utterance is where the bot properly recognized the utterance and activated the associated intent. A missed utterance was not recognized by the bot and didn't activate an intent. Utterances can be aggregated for a bot alias or for a bot version, but not both at the same time. Utterances statistics are not generated under the following conditions: <ul> <li> The <code>childDirected</code> field was set to true when the bot was created. </li> <li> You are using slot obfuscation with one or more slots. </li> <li> You opted out of participating in improving Amazon Lex. </li> </ul>

          Removes session information for a specified bot, alias, and user ID. You can use this operation to restart a conversation with a bot. When you remove a session, the entire history of the session is removed so that you can start again. You don't need to delete a session. Sessions have a time limit and will expire. Set the session time limit when you create the bot. The default is 5 minutes, but you can specify anything between 1 minute and 24 hours. If you specify a bot or alias ID that doesn't exist, you receive a <code>BadRequestException.</code> If the locale doesn't exist in the bot, or if the locale hasn't been enables for the alias, you receive a <code>BadRequestException</code>.

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Creates a snapshot of a block storage disk. You can use snapshots for backups, to make copies of disks, and to save data before shutting down a Lightsail instance. You can take a snapshot of an attached disk that is in use; however, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your disk at the time the snapshot command is issued. This may exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file systems on the disk long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. Nevertheless, if you cannot pause all file writes to the disk, you should unmount the disk from within the Lightsail instance, issue the create disk snapshot command, and then remount the disk to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your disk while the snapshot status is pending. You can also use this operation to create a snapshot of an instance's system volume. You might want to do this, for example, to recover data from the system volume of a botched instance or to create a backup of the system volume like you would for a block storage disk. To create a snapshot of a system volume, just define the <code>instance name</code> parameter when issuing the snapshot command, and a snapshot of the defined instance's system volume will be created. After the snapshot is available, you can create a block storage disk from the snapshot and attach it to a running instance to access the data on the disk. The <code>create disk snapshot</code> operation supports tag-based access control via request tags.

          Creates or updates an alarm, and associates it with the specified metric. An alarm is used to monitor a single metric for one of your resources. When a metric condition is met, the alarm can notify you by email, SMS text message, and a banner displayed on the Amazon Lightsail console. For more information, see <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-alarms">Alarms in Amazon Lightsail</a>. When this action creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to <code>INSUFFICIENT_DATA</code>. The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then executed. When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm. The alarm is then evaluated with the updated configuration.

          Updates the bundle, or storage plan, of an existing Amazon Lightsail bucket. A bucket bundle specifies the monthly cost, storage space, and data transfer quota for a bucket. You can update a bucket's bundle only one time within a monthly AWS billing cycle. To determine if you can update a bucket's bundle, use the <a>GetBuckets</a> action. The <code>ableToUpdateBundle</code> parameter in the response will indicate whether you can currently update a bucket's bundle. Update a bucket's bundle if it's consistently going over its storage space or data transfer quota, or if a bucket's usage is consistently in the lower range of its storage space or data transfer quota. Due to the unpredictable usage fluctuations that a bucket might experience, we strongly recommend that you update a bucket's bundle only as a long-term strategy, instead of as a short-term, monthly cost-cutting measure. Choose a bucket bundle that will provide the bucket with ample storage space and data transfer for a long time to come.

          Creates an export task, which allows you to efficiently export data from a log group to an Amazon S3 bucket. When you perform a <code>CreateExportTask</code> operation, you must use credentials that have permission to write to the S3 bucket that you specify as the destination. This is an asynchronous call. If all the required information is provided, this operation initiates an export task and responds with the ID of the task. After the task has started, you can use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeExportTasks.html">DescribeExportTasks</a> to get the status of the export task. Each account can only have one active (<code>RUNNING</code> or <code>PENDING</code>) export task at a time. To cancel an export task, use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_CancelExportTask.html">CancelExportTask</a>. You can export logs from multiple log groups or multiple time ranges to the same S3 bucket. To separate out log data for each export task, you can specify a prefix to be used as the Amazon S3 key prefix for all exported objects. Exporting to S3 buckets that are encrypted with AES-256 is supported. Exporting to S3 buckets encrypted with SSE-KMS is not supported.

          Lists log events from the specified log stream. You can list all of the log events or filter using a time range. By default, this operation returns as many log events as can fit in a response size of 1MB (up to 10,000 log events). You can get additional log events by specifying one of the tokens in a subsequent call. This operation can return empty results while there are more log events available through the token.

          Creates or updates a destination. This operation is used only to create destinations for cross-account subscriptions. A destination encapsulates a physical resource (such as an Amazon Kinesis stream) and enables you to subscribe to a real-time stream of log events for a different account, ingested using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutLogEvents.html">PutLogEvents</a>. Through an access policy, a destination controls what is written to it. By default, <code>PutDestination</code> does not set any access policy with the destination, which means a cross-account user cannot call <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutSubscriptionFilter.html">PutSubscriptionFilter</a> against this destination. To enable this, the destination owner must call <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDestinationPolicy.html">PutDestinationPolicy</a> after <code>PutDestination</code>. To perform a <code>PutDestination</code> operation, you must also have the <code>iam:PassRole</code> permission.

          Uploads a batch of log events to the specified log stream. You must include the sequence token obtained from the response of the previous call. An upload in a newly created log stream does not require a sequence token. You can also get the sequence token in the <code>expectedSequenceToken</code> field from <code>InvalidSequenceTokenException</code>. If you call <code>PutLogEvents</code> twice within a narrow time period using the same value for <code>sequenceToken</code>, both calls might be successful or one might be rejected. The batch of events must satisfy the following constraints: <ul> <li> The maximum batch size is 1,048,576 bytes. This size is calculated as the sum of all event messages in UTF-8, plus 26 bytes for each log event. </li> <li> None of the log events in the batch can be more than 2 hours in the future. </li> <li> None of the log events in the batch can be older than 14 days or older than the retention period of the log group. </li> <li> The log events in the batch must be in chronological order by their timestamp. The timestamp is the time the event occurred, expressed as the number of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. (In Amazon Web Services Tools for PowerShell and the Amazon Web Services SDK for .NET, the timestamp is specified in .NET format: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss. For example, 2017-09-15T13:45:30.) </li> <li> A batch of log events in a single request cannot span more than 24 hours. Otherwise, the operation fails. </li> <li> The maximum number of log events in a batch is 10,000. </li> <li> There is a quota of 5 requests per second per log stream. Additional requests are throttled. This quota can't be changed. </li> </ul> If a call to <code>PutLogEvents</code> returns "UnrecognizedClientException" the most likely cause is an invalid Amazon Web Services access key ID or secret key.

          Creates a scheduled inference. Scheduling an inference is setting up a continuous real-time inference plan to analyze new measurement data. When setting up the schedule, you provide an S3 bucket location for the input data, assign it a delimiter between separate entries in the data, set an offset delay if desired, and set the frequency of inferencing. You must also provide an S3 bucket location for the output data.

          Creates an ML model for data inference. A machine-learning (ML) model is a mathematical model that finds patterns in your data. In Amazon Lookout for Equipment, the model learns the patterns of normal behavior and detects abnormal behavior that could be potential equipment failure (or maintenance events). The models are made by analyzing normal data and abnormalities in machine behavior that have already occurred. Your model is trained using a portion of the data from your dataset and uses that data to learn patterns of normal behavior and abnormal patterns that lead to equipment failure. Another portion of the data is used to evaluate the model's accuracy.

          Creates a new version of a model within an an Amazon Lookout for Vision project. <code>CreateModel</code> is an asynchronous operation in which Amazon Lookout for Vision trains, tests, and evaluates a new version of a model. To get the current status, check the <code>Status</code> field returned in the response from <a>DescribeModel</a>. If the project has a single dataset, Amazon Lookout for Vision internally splits the dataset to create a training and a test dataset. If the project has a training and a test dataset, Lookout for Vision uses the respective datasets to train and test the model. After training completes, the evaluation metrics are stored at the location specified in <code>OutputConfig</code>. This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>lookoutvision:CreateModel</code> operation. If you want to tag your model, you also require permission to the <code>lookoutvision:TagResource</code> operation.

          Creates a <code>DataSource</code> from a database hosted on an Amazon Redshift cluster. A <code>DataSource</code> references data that can be used to perform either <code>CreateMLModel</code>, <code>CreateEvaluation</code>, or <code>CreateBatchPrediction</code> operations. <code>CreateDataSourceFromRedshift</code> is an asynchronous operation. In response to <code>CreateDataSourceFromRedshift</code>, Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) immediately returns and sets the <code>DataSource</code> status to <code>PENDING</code>. After the <code>DataSource</code> is created and ready for use, Amazon ML sets the <code>Status</code> parameter to <code>COMPLETED</code>. <code>DataSource</code> in <code>COMPLETED</code> or <code>PENDING</code> states can be used to perform only <code>CreateMLModel</code>, <code>CreateEvaluation</code>, or <code>CreateBatchPrediction</code> operations. If Amazon ML can't accept the input source, it sets the <code>Status</code> parameter to <code>FAILED</code> and includes an error message in the <code>Message</code> attribute of the <code>GetDataSource</code> operation response. The observations should be contained in the database hosted on an Amazon Redshift cluster and should be specified by a <code>SelectSqlQuery</code> query. Amazon ML executes an <code>Unload</code> command in Amazon Redshift to transfer the result set of the <code>SelectSqlQuery</code> query to <code>S3StagingLocation</code>. After the <code>DataSource</code> has been created, it's ready for use in evaluations and batch predictions. If you plan to use the <code>DataSource</code> to train an <code>MLModel</code>, the <code>DataSource</code> also requires a recipe. A recipe describes how each input variable will be used in training an <code>MLModel</code>. Will the variable be included or excluded from training? Will the variable be manipulated; for example, will it be combined with another variable or will it be split apart into word combinations? The recipe provides answers to these questions. You can't change an existing datasource, but you can copy and modify the settings from an existing Amazon Redshift datasource to create a new datasource. To do so, call <code>GetDataSource</code> for an existing datasource and copy the values to a <code>CreateDataSource</code> call. Change the settings that you want to change and make sure that all required fields have the appropriate values.

The observation data used in a <code>DataSource</code> should be ready to use; that is, it should have a consistent structure, and missing data values should be kept to a minimum. The observation data must reside in one or more .csv files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) location, along with a schema that describes the data items by name and type. The same schema must be used for all of the data files referenced by the <code>DataSource</code>.

Like a <code>DataSource</code> for an <code>MLModel</code>, the <code>DataSource</code> for an <code>Evaluation</code> contains values for the <code>Target Variable</code>. The <code>Evaluation</code> compares the predicted result for each observation to the actual outcome and provides a summary so that you know how effective the <code>MLModel</code> functions on the test data. Evaluation generates a relevant performance metric, such as BinaryAUC, RegressionRMSE or MulticlassAvgFScore based on the corresponding <code>MLModelType</code>: <code>BINARY</code>, <code>REGRESSION</code> or <code>MULTICLASS</code>. <code>CreateEvaluation</code> is an asynchronous operation. In response to <code>CreateEvaluation</code>, Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) immediately returns and sets the evaluation status to <code>PENDING</code>.

          Lists the properties of all containers in AWS Elemental MediaStore. You can query to receive all the containers in one response. Or you can include the <code>MaxResults</code> parameter to receive a limited number of containers in each response. In this case, the response includes a token. To get the next set of containers, send the command again, this time with the <code>NextToken</code> parameter (with the returned token as its value). The next set of responses appears, with a token if there are still more containers to receive. See also <a>DescribeContainer</a>, which gets the properties of one container.

For information about the data that is included in an access policy, see the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/iam/">AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide</a>. For this release of the REST API, you can create only one policy for a container. If you enter <code>PutContainerPolicy</code> twice, the second command modifies the existing policy.

          Sets the cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) configuration on a container so that the container can service cross-origin requests. For example, you might want to enable a request whose origin is http://www.example.com to access your AWS Elemental MediaStore container at my.example.container.com by using the browser's XMLHttpRequest capability. To enable CORS on a container, you attach a CORS policy to the container. In the CORS policy, you configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods that can be executed on your container. The policy can contain up to 398,000 characters. You can add up to 100 rules to a CORS policy. If more than one rule applies, the service uses the first applicable rule listed. To learn more about CORS, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediastore/latest/ug/cors-policy.html">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in AWS Elemental MediaStore</a>.

          A tag is a key-value pair where the key and value are case-sensitive. You can use tags to categorize and track all your MemoryDB resources. When you add or remove tags on clusters, those actions will be replicated to all nodes in the cluster. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/MemoryDB/latest/devguide/iam.resourcelevelpermissions.html">Resource-level permissions</a>. For example, you can use cost-allocation tags to your MemoryDB resources, Amazon generates a cost allocation report as a comma-separated value (CSV) file with your usage and costs aggregated by your tags. You can apply tags that represent business categories (such as cost centers, application names, or owners) to organize your costs across multiple services. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/MemoryDB/latest/devguide/tagging.html">Using Cost Allocation Tags</a>.

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Creates a new DB cluster parameter group. Parameters in a DB cluster parameter group apply to all of the instances in a DB cluster. A DB cluster parameter group is initially created with the default parameters for the database engine used by instances in the DB cluster. To provide custom values for any of the parameters, you must modify the group after creating it using <a>ModifyDBClusterParameterGroup</a>. Once you've created a DB cluster parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB cluster using <a>ModifyDBCluster</a>. When you associate a new DB cluster parameter group with a running DB cluster, you need to reboot the DB instances in the DB cluster without failover for the new DB cluster parameter group and associated settings to take effect. <important> After you create a DB cluster parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB cluster that uses that DB cluster parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon Neptune to fully complete the create action before the DB cluster parameter group is used as the default for a new DB cluster. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB cluster, such as the character set for the default database defined by the <code>character_set_database</code> parameter. You can use the <i>Parameter Groups</i> option of the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon Neptune console</a> or the <a>DescribeDBClusterParameters</a> command to verify that your DB cluster parameter group has been created or modified. </important>

          Creates an event notification subscription. This action requires a topic ARN (Amazon Resource Name) created by either the Neptune console, the SNS console, or the SNS API. To obtain an ARN with SNS, you must create a topic in Amazon SNS and subscribe to the topic. The ARN is displayed in the SNS console. You can specify the type of source (SourceType) you want to be notified of, provide a list of Neptune sources (SourceIds) that triggers the events, and provide a list of event categories (EventCategories) for events you want to be notified of. For example, you can specify SourceType = db-instance, SourceIds = mydbinstance1, mydbinstance2 and EventCategories = Availability, Backup. If you specify both the SourceType and SourceIds, such as SourceType = db-instance and SourceIdentifier = myDBInstance1, you are notified of all the db-instance events for the specified source. If you specify a SourceType but do not specify a SourceIdentifier, you receive notice of the events for that source type for all your Neptune sources. If you do not specify either the SourceType nor the SourceIdentifier, you are notified of events generated from all Neptune sources belonging to your customer account.

          The DeleteDBInstance action deletes a previously provisioned DB instance. When you delete a DB instance, all automated backups for that instance are deleted and can't be recovered. Manual DB snapshots of the DB instance to be deleted by <code>DeleteDBInstance</code> are not deleted. If you request a final DB snapshot the status of the Amazon Neptune DB instance is <code>deleting</code> until the DB snapshot is created. The API action <code>DescribeDBInstance</code> is used to monitor the status of this operation. The action can't be canceled or reverted once submitted. Note that when a DB instance is in a failure state and has a status of <code>failed</code>, <code>incompatible-restore</code>, or <code>incompatible-network</code>, you can only delete it when the <code>SkipFinalSnapshot</code> parameter is set to <code>true</code>. You can't delete a DB instance if it is the only instance in the DB cluster, or if it has deletion protection enabled.

To add or remove access for an Amazon account to copy or restore a manual DB cluster snapshot, or to make the manual DB cluster snapshot public or private, use the <a>ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute</a> API action.

          Forces a failover for a DB cluster. A failover for a DB cluster promotes one of the Read Replicas (read-only instances) in the DB cluster to be the primary instance (the cluster writer). Amazon Neptune will automatically fail over to a Read Replica, if one exists, when the primary instance fails. You can force a failover when you want to simulate a failure of a primary instance for testing. Because each instance in a DB cluster has its own endpoint address, you will need to clean up and re-establish any existing connections that use those endpoint addresses when the failover is complete.

Do not add the <code>all</code> value for any manual DB cluster snapshots that contain private information that you don't want available to all Amazon accounts. If a manual DB cluster snapshot is encrypted, it can be shared, but only by specifying a list of authorized Amazon account IDs for the <code>ValuesToAdd</code> parameter. You can't use <code>all</code> as a value for that parameter in this case.

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Create a new Studio. When creating a Studio, two IAM roles must be provided: the admin role and the user Role. These roles are assumed by your users when they log in to the Nimble Studio portal. The user role must have the AmazonNimbleStudio-StudioUser managed policy attached for the portal to function properly. The Admin Role must have the AmazonNimbleStudio-StudioAdmin managed policy attached for the portal to function properly. You may optionally specify a KMS key in the StudioEncryptionConfiguration. In Nimble Studio, resource names, descriptions, initialization scripts, and other data you provide are always encrypted at rest using an KMS key. By default, this key is owned by Amazon Web Services and managed on your behalf. You may provide your own KMS key when calling CreateStudio to encrypt this data using a key you own and manage. When providing an KMS key during studio creation, Nimble Studio creates KMS grants in your account to provide your studio user and admin roles access to these KMS keys. If you delete this grant, the studio will no longer be accessible to your portal users. If you delete the studio KMS key, your studio will no longer be accessible.

However, AWS OpsWorks Stacks currently supports only one cluster per layer, so the result set has a maximum of one element. <b>Required Permissions</b>: To use this action, an IAM user must have a Show, Deploy, or Manage permissions level for the stack or an attached policy that explicitly grants permission.

          Registers instances that were created outside of AWS OpsWorks Stacks with a specified stack. <note> We do not recommend using this action to register instances. The complete registration operation includes two tasks: installing the AWS OpsWorks Stacks agent on the instance, and registering the instance with the stack. <code>RegisterInstance</code> handles only the second step. You should instead use the AWS CLI <code>register</code> command, which performs the entire registration operation. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/registered-instances-register.html"> Registering an Instance with an AWS OpsWorks Stacks Stack</a>. </note> Registered instances have the same requirements as instances that are created by using the <a>CreateInstance</a> API. For example, registered instances must be running a supported Linux-based operating system, and they must have a supported instance type.

          Associates a new node with the server. For more information about how to disassociate a node, see <a>DisassociateNode</a>. On a Chef server: This command is an alternative to <code>knife bootstrap</code>. Example (Chef): <code>aws opsworks-cm associate-node --server-name <i>MyServer</i> --node-name <i>MyManagedNode</i> --engine-attributes "Name=<i>CHEF_ORGANIZATION</i>,Value=default" "Name=<i>CHEF_NODE_PUBLIC_KEY</i>,Value=<i>public-key-pem</i>"</code> On a Puppet server, this command is an alternative to the <code>puppet cert sign</code> command that signs a Puppet node CSR. Example (Puppet): <code>aws opsworks-cm associate-node --server-name <i>MyServer</i> --node-name <i>MyManagedNode</i> --engine-attributes "Name=<i>PUPPET_NODE_CSR</i>,Value=<i>csr-pem</i>"</code> A node can can only be associated with servers that are in a <code>HEALTHY</code> state. Otherwise, an <code>InvalidStateException</code> is thrown. A <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code> is thrown when the server does not exist. A <code>ValidationException</code> is raised when parameters of the request are not valid. The AssociateNode API call can be integrated into Auto Scaling configurations, AWS Cloudformation templates, or the user data of a server's instance.

          Creates an application-level backup of a server. While the server is in the <code>BACKING_UP</code> state, the server cannot be changed, and no additional backup can be created. Backups can be created for servers in <code>RUNNING</code>, <code>HEALTHY</code>, and <code>UNHEALTHY</code> states. By default, you can create a maximum of 50 manual backups. This operation is asynchronous. A <code>LimitExceededException</code> is thrown when the maximum number of manual backups is reached. An <code>InvalidStateException</code> is thrown when the server is not in any of the following states: RUNNING, HEALTHY, or UNHEALTHY. A <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code> is thrown when the server is not found. A <code>ValidationException</code> is thrown when parameters of the request are not valid.

          Creates and immedately starts a new server. The server is ready to use when it is in the <code>HEALTHY</code> state. By default, you can create a maximum of 10 servers. This operation is asynchronous. A <code>LimitExceededException</code> is thrown when you have created the maximum number of servers (10). A <code>ResourceAlreadyExistsException</code> is thrown when a server with the same name already exists in the account. A <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code> is thrown when you specify a backup ID that is not valid or is for a backup that does not exist. A <code>ValidationException</code> is thrown when parameters of the request are not valid. If you do not specify a security group by adding the <code>SecurityGroupIds</code> parameter, AWS OpsWorks creates a new security group. <i>Chef Automate:</i> The default security group opens the Chef server to the world on TCP port 443. If a KeyName is present, AWS OpsWorks enables SSH access. SSH is also open to the world on TCP port 22. <i>Puppet Enterprise:</i> The default security group opens TCP ports 22, 443, 4433, 8140, 8142, 8143, and 8170. If a KeyName is present, AWS OpsWorks enables SSH access. SSH is also open to the world on TCP port 22. By default, your server is accessible from any IP address. We recommend that you update your security group rules to allow access from known IP addresses and address ranges only. To edit security group rules, open Security Groups in the navigation pane of the EC2 management console. To specify your own domain for a server, and provide your own self-signed or CA-signed certificate and private key, specify values for <code>CustomDomain</code>, <code>CustomCertificate</code>, and <code>CustomPrivateKey</code>.

After the server is deleted, it is no longer returned by <code>DescribeServer</code> requests. If the AWS CloudFormation stack cannot be deleted, the server cannot be deleted. This operation is asynchronous. An <code>InvalidStateException</code> is thrown when a server deletion is already in progress.

When you run RestoreServer, the server's EC2 instance is deleted, and a new EC2 instance is configured. RestoreServer maintains the existing server endpoint, so configuration management of the server's client devices (nodes) should continue to work. Restoring from a backup is performed by creating a new EC2 instance. If restoration is successful, and the server is in a <code>HEALTHY</code> state, AWS OpsWorks CM switches traffic over to the new instance. After restoration is finished, the old EC2 instance is maintained in a <code>Running</code> or <code>Stopped</code> state, but is eventually terminated. This operation is asynchronous. An <code>InvalidStateException</code> is thrown when the server is not in a valid state. A <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code> is thrown when the server does not exist.

          Creates an AWS account that is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. This is an asynchronous request that AWS performs in the background. Because <code>CreateAccount</code> operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following: <ul> <li> Use the <code>Id</code> member of the <code>CreateAccountStatus</code> response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the <a>DescribeCreateAccountStatus</a> operation. </li> <li> Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the <code>CreateAccountResult</code> event. For information on using AWS CloudTrail with AWS Organizations, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_security_incident-response.html#orgs_cloudtrail-integration">Logging and monitoring in AWS Organizations</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide.</i> </li> </ul> The user who calls the API to create an account must have the <code>organizations:CreateAccount</code> permission. If you enabled all features in the organization, AWS Organizations creates the required service-linked role named <code>AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations</code>.

If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the <code>organizations:TagResource</code> permission. AWS Organizations preconfigures the new member account with a role (named <code>OrganizationAccountAccessRole</code> by default) that grants users in the management account administrator permissions in the new member account. Principals in the management account can assume the role. AWS Organizations clones the company name and address information for the new account from the organization's management account. This operation can be called only from the organization's management account.

For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/verifying-cloudtrail.html">Verifying AWS CloudTrail Is Enabled</a> in the <i>AWS GovCloud User Guide</i>. </li> </ul> If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the <code>organizations:TagResource</code> permission. The tags are attached to the commercial account associated with the GovCloud account, rather than the GovCloud account itself. To add tags to the GovCloud account, call the <a>TagResource</a> operation in the GovCloud Region after the new GovCloud account exists. You call this action from the management account of your organization in the commercial Region to create a standalone AWS account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region. After the account is created, the management account of an organization in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region can invite it to that organization. For more information on inviting standalone accounts in the AWS GovCloud (US) to join an organization, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-organizations.html">AWS Organizations</a> in the <i>AWS GovCloud User Guide.</i> Calling <code>CreateGovCloudAccount</code> is an asynchronous request that AWS performs in the background.

The account in the commercial Region is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. Both accounts are associated with the same email address. A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that allows the management account in the organization in the commercial Region to assume it. An AWS GovCloud (US) account is then created and associated with the commercial account that you just created. A role is also created in the new AWS GovCloud (US) account that can be assumed by the AWS GovCloud (US) account that is associated with the management account of the commercial organization.

After you perform this operation, you no longer can attach policies of the specified type to that root or to any organizational unit (OU) or account in that root. You can undo this by using the <a>EnablePolicyType</a> operation. This is an asynchronous request that AWS performs in the background. If you disable a policy type for a root, it still appears enabled for the organization if <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html">all features</a> are enabled for the organization. AWS recommends that you first use <a>ListRoots</a> to see the status of policy types for a specified root, and then use this operation. This operation can be called only from the organization's management account. To view the status of available policy types in the organization, use <a>DescribeOrganization</a>.

          Enables all features in an organization. This enables the use of organization policies that can restrict the services and actions that can be called in each account. Until you enable all features, you have access only to consolidated billing, and you can't use any of the advanced account administration features that AWS Organizations supports. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html">Enabling All Features in Your Organization</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide.</i> <important> This operation is required only for organizations that were created explicitly with only the consolidated billing features enabled. Calling this operation sends a handshake to every invited account in the organization. The feature set change can be finalized and the additional features enabled only after all administrators in the invited accounts approve the change by accepting the handshake. </important> After you enable all features, you can separately enable or disable individual policy types in a root using <a>EnablePolicyType</a> and <a>DisablePolicyType</a>. To see the status of policy types in a root, use <a>ListRoots</a>. After all invited member accounts accept the handshake, you finalize the feature set change by accepting the handshake that contains <code>"Action": "ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES"</code>. This completes the change. After you enable all features in your organization, the management account in the organization can apply policies on all member accounts. These policies can restrict what users and even administrators in those accounts can do. The management account can apply policies that prevent accounts from leaving the organization. Ensure that your account administrators are aware of this. This operation can be called only from the organization's management account.

          Creates a campaign by deploying a solution version. When a client calls the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetRecommendations.html">GetRecommendations</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetPersonalizedRanking.html">GetPersonalizedRanking</a> APIs, a campaign is specified in the request. <b>Minimum Provisioned TPS and Auto-Scaling</b> A transaction is a single <code>GetRecommendations</code> or <code>GetPersonalizedRanking</code> call. Transactions per second (TPS) is the throughput and unit of billing for Amazon Personalize. The minimum provisioned TPS (<code>minProvisionedTPS</code>) specifies the baseline throughput provisioned by Amazon Personalize, and thus, the minimum billing charge. If your TPS increases beyond <code>minProvisionedTPS</code>, Amazon Personalize auto-scales the provisioned capacity up and down, but never below <code>minProvisionedTPS</code>. There's a short time delay while the capacity is increased that might cause loss of transactions. The actual TPS used is calculated as the average requests/second within a 5-minute window. You pay for maximum of either the minimum provisioned TPS or the actual TPS. We recommend starting with a low <code>minProvisionedTPS</code>, track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and then increase the <code>minProvisionedTPS</code> as necessary. <b>Status</b> A campaign can be in one of the following states: <ul> <li> CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED </li> <li> DELETE PENDING &gt; DELETE IN_PROGRESS </li> </ul> To get the campaign status, call <a>DescribeCampaign</a>. <note> Wait until the <code>status</code> of the campaign is <code>ACTIVE</code> before asking the campaign for recommendations. </note> <p class="title"> <b>Related APIs</b> <ul> <li> <a>ListCampaigns</a> </li> <li> <a>DescribeCampaign</a> </li> <li> <a>UpdateCampaign</a> </li> <li> <a>DeleteCampaign</a> </li> </ul>

          Creates the configuration for training a model. A trained model is known as a solution. After the configuration is created, you train the model (create a solution) by calling the <a>CreateSolutionVersion</a> operation. Every time you call <code>CreateSolutionVersion</code>, a new version of the solution is created. After creating a solution version, you check its accuracy by calling <a>GetSolutionMetrics</a>.

The campaign provides recommendations to a client through the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetRecommendations.html">GetRecommendations</a> API. To train a model, Amazon Personalize requires training data and a recipe. The training data comes from the dataset group that you provide in the request. A recipe specifies the training algorithm and a feature transformation. You can specify one of the predefined recipes provided by Amazon Personalize.

When you perform a predictive inbox placement test, you provide a sample message that contains the content that you plan to send to your customers. Amazon Pinpoint then sends that message to special email addresses spread across several major email providers. After about 24 hours, the test is complete, and you can use the <code>GetDeliverabilityTestReport</code> operation to view the results of the test.

        <details>
          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Verifies an email identity for use with Amazon Pinpoint. In Amazon Pinpoint, an identity is an email address or domain that you use when you send email. Before you can use an identity to send email with Amazon Pinpoint, you first have to verify it. By verifying an address, you demonstrate that you're the owner of the address, and that you've given Amazon Pinpoint permission to send email from the address. When you verify an email address, Amazon Pinpoint sends an email to the address. Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link in the verification email. When you verify a domain, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens, which you can convert into CNAME tokens. You add these CNAME tokens to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon Pinpoint detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. It usually takes around 72 hours to complete the domain verification process.

When you enable feedback forwarding, Amazon Pinpoint sends you email notifications when bounce or complaint events occur. Amazon Pinpoint sends this notification to the address that you specified in the Return-Path header of the original email. When you disable feedback forwarding, Amazon Pinpoint sends notifications through other mechanisms, such as by notifying an Amazon SNS topic. You're required to have a method of tracking bounces and complaints. If you haven't set up another mechanism for receiving bounce or complaint notifications, Amazon Pinpoint sends an email notification when these events occur (even if this setting is disabled).

          Returns the list of voices that are available for use when requesting speech synthesis. Each voice speaks a specified language, is either male or female, and is identified by an ID, which is the ASCII version of the voice name. When synthesizing speech ( <code>SynthesizeSpeech</code> ), you provide the voice ID for the voice you want from the list of voices returned by <code>DescribeVoices</code>. For example, you want your news reader application to read news in a specific language, but giving a user the option to choose the voice. Using the <code>DescribeVoices</code> operation you can provide the user with a list of available voices to select from. You can optionally specify a language code to filter the available voices. For example, if you specify <code>en-US</code>, the operation returns a list of all available US English voices. This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>polly:DescribeVoices</code> action.

          Creates Amazon QuickSight customizations the current Amazon Web Services Region. Currently, you can add a custom default theme by using the <code>CreateAccountCustomization</code> or <code>UpdateAccountCustomization</code> API operation. To further customize Amazon QuickSight by removing Amazon QuickSight sample assets and videos for all new users, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/customizing-quicksight.html">Customizing Amazon QuickSight</a> in the <i>Amazon QuickSight User Guide.</i> You can create customizations for your Amazon Web Services account or, if you specify a namespace, for a Amazon QuickSight namespace instead. Customizations that apply to a namespace always override customizations that apply to an Amazon Web Services account. To find out which customizations apply, use the <code>DescribeAccountCustomization</code> API operation. Before you use the <code>CreateAccountCustomization</code> API operation to add a theme as the namespace default, make sure that you first share the theme with the namespace. If you don't share it with the namespace, the theme isn't visible to your users even if you make it the default theme. To check if the theme is shared, view the current permissions by using the <code> <a>DescribeThemePermissions</a> </code> API operation. To share the theme, grant permissions by using the <code> <a>UpdateThemePermissions</a> </code> API operation.

Users that access the namespace can share assets only with other users or groups in the same namespace. They can't see users and groups in other namespaces. You can create a namespace after your Amazon Web Services account is subscribed to Amazon QuickSight. The namespace must be unique within the Amazon Web Services account. By default, there is a limit of 100 namespaces per Amazon Web Services account. To increase your limit, create a ticket with Amazon Web Services Support.

A <i>template</i> is an entity in Amazon QuickSight that encapsulates the metadata required to create an analysis and that you can use to create s dashboard. A template adds a layer of abstraction by using placeholders to replace the dataset associated with the analysis. You can use templates to create dashboards by replacing dataset placeholders with datasets that follow the same schema that was used to create the source analysis and template.

          Deletes an analysis from Amazon QuickSight. You can optionally include a recovery window during which you can restore the analysis. If you don't specify a recovery window value, the operation defaults to 30 days. Amazon QuickSight attaches a <code>DeletionTime</code> stamp to the response that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Amazon QuickSight deletes the analysis permanently. At any time before recovery window ends, you can use the <code>RestoreAnalysis</code> API operation to remove the <code>DeletionTime</code> stamp and cancel the deletion of the analysis. The analysis remains visible in the API until it's deleted, so you can describe it but you can't make a template from it. An analysis that's scheduled for deletion isn't accessible in the Amazon QuickSight console. To access it in the console, restore it. Deleting an analysis doesn't delete the dashboards that you publish from it.

          Describes the customizations associated with the provided Amazon Web Services account and Amazon Amazon QuickSight namespace in an Amazon Web Services Region. The Amazon QuickSight console evaluates which customizations to apply by running this API operation with the <code>Resolved</code> flag included. To determine what customizations display when you run this command, it can help to visualize the relationship of the entities involved. <ul> <li> <code>Amazon Web Services account</code> - The Amazon Web Services account exists at the top of the hierarchy. It has the potential to use all of the Amazon Web Services Regions and AWS Services. When you subscribe to Amazon QuickSight, you choose one Amazon Web Services Region to use as your home Region. That's where your free SPICE capacity is located. You can use Amazon QuickSight in any supported Amazon Web Services Region. </li> <li> <code>Amazon Web Services Region</code> - In each Amazon Web Services Region where you sign in to Amazon QuickSight at least once, Amazon QuickSight acts as a separate instance of the same service. If you have a user directory, it resides in us-east-1, which is the US East (N. Virginia). Generally speaking, these users have access to Amazon QuickSight in any Amazon Web Services Region, unless they are constrained to a namespace. To run the command in a different Amazon Web Services Region, you change your Region settings. If you're using the AWS CLI, you can use one of the following options: <ul> <li> Use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-options.html">command line options</a>. </li> <li> Use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html">named profiles</a>. </li> <li> Run <code>aws configure</code> to change your default Amazon Web Services Region. Use Enter to key the same settings for your keys. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html">Configuring the AWS CLI</a>. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <code>Namespace</code> - A Amazon QuickSight namespace is a partition that contains users and assets (data sources, datasets, dashboards, and so on). To access assets that are in a specific namespace, users and groups must also be part of the same namespace. People who share a namespace are completely isolated from users and assets in other namespaces, even if they are in the same Amazon Web Services account and Amazon Web Services Region. </li> <li> <code>Applied customizations</code> - Within an Amazon Web Services Region, a set of Amazon QuickSight customizations can apply to an Amazon Web Services account or to a namespace. Settings that you apply to a namespace override settings that you apply to an Amazon Web Services account. All settings are isolated to a single Amazon Web Services Region. To apply them in other Amazon Web Services Regions, run the <code>CreateAccountCustomization</code> command in each Amazon Web Services Region where you want to apply the same customizations. </li> </ul>

          Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified Amazon QuickSight resource. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. You can use the <code>TagResource</code> operation with a resource that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the resource, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the resource. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the resource, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag. You can associate as many as 50 tags with a resource. Amazon QuickSight supports tagging on data set, data source, dashboard, and template. Tagging for Amazon QuickSight works in a similar way to tagging for other AWS services, except for the following: <ul> <li> You can't use tags to track AWS costs for Amazon QuickSight. This restriction is because Amazon QuickSight costs are based on users and SPICE capacity, which aren't taggable resources. </li> <li> Amazon QuickSight doesn't currently support the Tag Editor for Resource Groups. </li> </ul>

        <details>
          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Copies a snapshot of a DB cluster. To copy a DB cluster snapshot from a shared manual DB cluster snapshot, <code>SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the shared DB cluster snapshot. You can copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services Region. In that case, the Amazon Web Services Region where you call the <code>CopyDBClusterSnapshot</code> action is the destination Amazon Web Services Region for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied to. To copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services Region, you must provide the following values: <ul> <li> <code>KmsKeyId</code> - The Amazon Web Services Key Management System (Amazon Web Services KMS) key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. </li> <li> <code>PreSignedUrl</code> - A URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the <code>CopyDBClusterSnapshot</code> action to be called in the source Amazon Web Services Region where the DB cluster snapshot is copied from. The pre-signed URL must be a valid request for the <code>CopyDBClusterSnapshot</code> API action that can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. The pre-signed URL request must contain the following parameter values: <ul> <li> <code>KmsKeyId</code> - The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for the KMS key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the <code>CopyDBClusterSnapshot</code> action that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the action contained in the pre-signed URL. </li> <li> <code>DestinationRegion</code> - The name of the Amazon Web Services Region that the DB cluster snapshot is to be created in. </li> <li> <code>SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your <code>SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> looks like the following example: <code>arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:aurora-cluster1-snapshot-20161115</code>. </li> </ul> To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html"> Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html"> Signature Version 4 Signing Process</a>. <note> If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify <code>SourceRegion</code> (or <code>--source-region</code> for the CLI) instead of specifying <code>PreSignedUrl</code> manually. Specifying <code>SourceRegion</code> autogenerates a pre-signed URL that is a valid request for the operation that can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region. </note> </li> <li> <code>TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> - The identifier for the new copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. </li> <li> <code>SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the ARN format for the source Amazon Web Services Region and is the same value as the <code>SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> in the pre-signed URL. </li> </ul> To cancel the copy operation once it is in progress, delete the target DB cluster snapshot identified by <code>TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier</code> while that DB cluster snapshot is in "copying" status. For more information on copying encrypted DB cluster snapshots from one Amazon Web Services Region to another, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_CopySnapshot.html"> Copying a Snapshot</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide.</i> For more information on Amazon Aurora, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/CHAP_AuroraOverview.html"> What Is Amazon Aurora?</a> in the <i>Amazon Aurora User Guide.</i> <note> This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters. </note>

          Creates a custom DB engine version (CEV). A CEV is a binary volume snapshot of a database engine and specific AMI. The only supported engine is Oracle Database 19c Enterprise Edition with the January 2021 or later RU/RUR. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-cev.html#custom-cev.preparing.manifest"> Amazon RDS Custom requirements and limitations</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>. Amazon RDS, which is a fully managed service, supplies the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and database software. The Amazon RDS database software is preinstalled, so you need only select a DB engine and version, and create your database. With Amazon RDS Custom, you upload your database installation files in Amazon S3. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-cev.html#custom-cev.html#custom-cev.preparing"> Preparing to create a CEV</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>. When you create a custom engine version, you specify the files in a JSON document called a CEV manifest. This document describes installation .zip files stored in Amazon S3. RDS Custom creates your CEV from the installation files that you provided. This service model is called Bring Your Own Media (BYOM). Creation takes approximately two hours. If creation fails, RDS Custom issues <code>RDS-EVENT-0196</code> with the message <code>Creation failed for custom engine version</code>, and includes details about the failure. For example, the event prints missing files. After you create the CEV, it is available for use. You can create multiple CEVs, and create multiple RDS Custom instances from any CEV. You can also change the status of a CEV to make it available or inactive. <note> The MediaImport service that imports files from Amazon S3 to create CEVs isn't integrated with Amazon Web Services CloudTrail. If you turn on data logging for Amazon RDS in CloudTrail, calls to the <code>CreateCustomDbEngineVersion</code> event aren't logged. However, you might see calls from the API gateway that accesses your Amazon S3 bucket. These calls originate from the MediaImport service for the <code>CreateCustomDbEngineVersion</code> event. </note> For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-cev.html#custom-cev.create"> Creating a CEV</a> in the <i>Amazon RDS User Guide</i>.

A DB cluster parameter group is initially created with the default parameters for the database engine used by instances in the DB cluster. To provide custom values for any of the parameters, you must modify the group after creating it using <code>ModifyDBClusterParameterGroup</code>. Once you've created a DB cluster parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB cluster using <code>ModifyDBCluster</code>.

          Forces a failover for a DB cluster. A failover for a DB cluster promotes one of the Aurora Replicas (read-only instances) in the DB cluster to be the primary instance (the cluster writer). Amazon Aurora will automatically fail over to an Aurora Replica, if one exists, when the primary instance fails. You can force a failover when you want to simulate a failure of a primary instance for testing. Because each instance in a DB cluster has its own endpoint address, you will need to clean up and re-establish any existing connections that use those endpoint addresses when the failover is complete.

A failover for an Aurora global database promotes one of secondary read-only DB clusters to be the primary DB cluster and demotes the primary DB cluster to being a secondary (read-only) DB cluster. In other words, the role of the current primary DB cluster and the selected (target) DB cluster are switched. The selected secondary DB cluster assumes full read/write capabilities for the Aurora global database.

This allows Amazon RDS to fully complete the create action before the parameter group is used as the default for a new DB cluster. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB cluster, such as the character set for the default database defined by the <code>character_set_database</code> parameter.

          Modifies the parameters of a DB parameter group. To modify more than one parameter, submit a list of the following: <code>ParameterName</code>, <code>ParameterValue</code>, and <code>ApplyMethod</code>. A maximum of 20 parameters can be modified in a single request. <important> After you modify a DB parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB instance that uses that DB parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon RDS to fully complete the modify action before the parameter group is used as the default for a new DB instance. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB instance, such as the character set for the default database defined by the <code>character_set_database</code> parameter. You can use the <i>Parameter Groups</i> option of the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon RDS console</a> or the <i>DescribeDBParameters</i> command to verify that your DB parameter group has been created or modified. </important>

If you want to replace your original DB instance with the new, restored DB instance, then rename your original DB instance before you call the RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot action. RDS doesn't allow two DB instances with the same name. After you have renamed your original DB instance with a different identifier, then you can pass the original name of the DB instance as the DBInstanceIdentifier in the call to the RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot action.

          Adds an inbound (ingress) rule to an Amazon Redshift security group. Depending on whether the application accessing your cluster is running on the Internet or an Amazon EC2 instance, you can authorize inbound access to either a Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)/Internet Protocol (IP) range or to an Amazon EC2 security group. You can add as many as 20 ingress rules to an Amazon Redshift security group. If you authorize access to an Amazon EC2 security group, specify <i>EC2SecurityGroupName</i> and <i>EC2SecurityGroupOwnerId</i>. The Amazon EC2 security group and Amazon Redshift cluster must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region. If you authorize access to a CIDR/IP address range, specify <i>CIDRIP</i>. For an overview of CIDR blocks, see the Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing">Classless Inter-Domain Routing</a>. You must also associate the security group with a cluster so that clients running on these IP addresses or the EC2 instance are authorized to connect to the cluster.

          Creates an Amazon Redshift event notification subscription. This action requires an ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of an Amazon SNS topic created by either the Amazon Redshift console, the Amazon SNS console, or the Amazon SNS API. To obtain an ARN with Amazon SNS, you must create a topic in Amazon SNS and subscribe to the topic. The ARN is displayed in the SNS console. You can specify the source type, and lists of Amazon Redshift source IDs, event categories, and event severities. Notifications will be sent for all events you want that match those criteria. For example, you can specify source type = cluster, source ID = my-cluster-1 and mycluster2, event categories = Availability, Backup, and severity = ERROR. The subscription will only send notifications for those ERROR events in the Availability and Backup categories for the specified clusters. If you specify both the source type and source IDs, such as source type = cluster and source identifier = my-cluster-1, notifications will be sent for all the cluster events for my-cluster-1. If you specify a source type but do not specify a source identifier, you will receive notice of the events for the objects of that type in your Amazon Web Services account. If you do not specify either the SourceType nor the SourceIdentifier, you will be notified of events generated from all Amazon Redshift sources belonging to your Amazon Web Services account. You must specify a source type if you specify a source ID.

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Compares a face in the <i>source</i> input image with each of the 100 largest faces detected in the <i>target</i> input image. If the source image contains multiple faces, the service detects the largest face and compares it with each face detected in the target image. <note> CompareFaces uses machine learning algorithms, which are probabilistic. A false negative is an incorrect prediction that a face in the target image has a low similarity confidence score when compared to the face in the source image. To reduce the probability of false negatives, we recommend that you compare the target image against multiple source images. If you plan to use <code>CompareFaces</code> to make a decision that impacts an individual's rights, privacy, or access to services, we recommend that you pass the result to a human for review and further validation before taking action. </note> You pass the input and target images either as base64-encoded image bytes or as references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file. In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, role, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match. <note> By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80% are returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the <code>SimilarityThreshold</code> parameter. </note> <code>CompareFaces</code> also returns an array of faces that don't match the source image. For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also returns information about the face in the source image, including the bounding box of the face and confidence value. The <code>QualityFilter</code> input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that donâ€™t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Use <code>QualityFilter</code> to set the quality bar by specifying <code>LOW</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, or <code>HIGH</code>. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify <code>NONE</code>. The default value is <code>NONE</code>. If the image doesn't contain Exif metadata, <code>CompareFaces</code> returns orientation information for the source and target images. Use these values to display the images with the correct image orientation. If no faces are detected in the source or target images, <code>CompareFaces</code> returns an <code>InvalidParameterException</code> error. <note> This is a stateless API operation. That is, data returned by this operation doesn't persist. </note> For an example, see Comparing Faces in Images in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:CompareFaces</code> action.

Each <code>CustomLabel</code> object provides the label name (<code>Name</code>), the level of confidence that the image contains the object (<code>Confidence</code>), and object location information, if it exists, for the label on the image (<code>Geometry</code>). To filter labels that are returned, specify a value for <code>MinConfidence</code>. <code>DetectCustomLabelsLabels</code> only returns labels with a confidence that's higher than the specified value. The value of <code>MinConfidence</code> maps to the assumed threshold values created during training. For more information, see <i>Assumed threshold</i> in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide. Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels metrics expresses an assumed threshold as a floating point value between 0-1. The range of <code>MinConfidence</code> normalizes the threshold value to a percentage value (0-100). Confidence responses from <code>DetectCustomLabels</code> are also returned as a percentage. You can use <code>MinConfidence</code> to change the precision and recall or your model. For more information, see <i>Analyzing an image</i> in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide. If you don't specify a value for <code>MinConfidence</code>, <code>DetectCustomLabels</code> returns labels based on the assumed threshold of each label. This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist any data. This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:DetectCustomLabels</code> action. For more information, see <i>Analyzing an image</i> in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide.

          Detects faces within an image that is provided as input. <code>DetectFaces</code> detects the 100 largest faces in the image. For each face detected, the operation returns face details. These details include a bounding box of the face, a confidence value (that the bounding box contains a face), and a fixed set of attributes such as facial landmarks (for example, coordinates of eye and mouth), presence of beard, sunglasses, and so on. The face-detection algorithm is most effective on frontal faces. For non-frontal or obscured faces, the algorithm might not detect the faces or might detect faces with lower confidence. You pass the input image either as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file. <note> This is a stateless API operation.

          Detects instances of real-world entities within an image (JPEG or PNG) provided as input. This includes objects like flower, tree, and table; events like wedding, graduation, and birthday party; and concepts like landscape, evening, and nature. For an example, see Analyzing Images Stored in an Amazon S3 Bucket in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. <note> <code>DetectLabels</code> does not support the detection of activities. However, activity detection is supported for label detection in videos. For more information, see StartLabelDetection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. </note> You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file. For each object, scene, and concept the API returns one or more labels. Each label provides the object name, and the level of confidence that the image contains the object. For example, suppose the input image has a lighthouse, the sea, and a rock. The response includes all three labels, one for each object. <code>{Name: lighthouse, Confidence: 98.4629}</code> <code>{Name: rock,Confidence: 79.2097}</code> <code> {Name: sea,Confidence: 75.061}</code> In the preceding example, the operation returns one label for each of the three objects. The operation can also return multiple labels for the same object in the image. For example, if the input image shows a flower (for example, a tulip), the operation might return the following three labels. <code>{Name: flower,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> <code>{Name: plant,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> <code>{Name: tulip,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> In this example, the detection algorithm more precisely identifies the flower as a tulip. In response, the API returns an array of labels. In addition, the response also includes the orientation correction. Optionally, you can specify <code>MinConfidence</code> to control the confidence threshold for the labels returned. The default is 55%. You can also add the <code>MaxLabels</code> parameter to limit the number of labels returned. <note> If the object detected is a person, the operation doesn't provide the same facial details that the <a>DetectFaces</a> operation provides. </note> <code>DetectLabels</code> returns bounding boxes for instances of common object labels in an array of <a>Instance</a> objects. An <code>Instance</code> object contains a <a>BoundingBox</a> object, for the location of the label on the image. It also includes the confidence by which the bounding box was detected. <code>DetectLabels</code> also returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a detected car might be assigned the label <i>car</i>. The label <i>car</i> has two parent labels: <i>Vehicle</i> (its parent) and <i>Transportation</i> (its grandparent). The response returns the entire list of ancestors for a label. Each ancestor is a unique label in the response. In the previous example, <i>Car</i>, <i>Vehicle</i>, and <i>Transportation</i> are returned as unique labels in the response. This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist any data. This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:DetectLabels</code> action.

If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, you must pass it as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. For the AWS CLI, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a .png or .jpeg formatted file. The <code>DetectText</code> operation returns text in an array of <a>TextDetection</a> elements, <code>TextDetections</code>. Each <code>TextDetection</code> element provides information about a single word or line of text that was detected in the image. A word is one or more ISO basic latin script characters that are not separated by spaces. <code>DetectText</code> can detect up to 100 words in an image. A line is a string of equally spaced words. A line isn't necessarily a complete sentence. For example, a driver's license number is detected as a line. A line ends when there is no aligned text after it. Also, a line ends when there is a large gap between words, relative to the length of the words. This means, depending on the gap between words, Amazon Rekognition may detect multiple lines in text aligned in the same direction. Periods don't represent the end of a line. If a sentence spans multiple lines, the <code>DetectText</code> operation returns multiple lines. To determine whether a <code>TextDetection</code> element is a line of text or a word, use the <code>TextDetection</code> object <code>Type</code> field. To be detected, text must be within +/- 90 degrees orientation of the horizontal axis. For more information, see DetectText in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

          Detects faces in the input image and adds them to the specified collection. Amazon Rekognition doesn't save the actual faces that are detected. Instead, the underlying detection algorithm first detects the faces in the input image. For each face, the algorithm extracts facial features into a feature vector, and stores it in the backend database. Amazon Rekognition uses feature vectors when it performs face match and search operations using the <a>SearchFaces</a> and <a>SearchFacesByImage</a> operations. For more information, see Adding Faces to a Collection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. To get the number of faces in a collection, call <a>DescribeCollection</a>. If you're using version 1.0 of the face detection model, <code>IndexFaces</code> indexes the 15 largest faces in the input image. Later versions of the face detection model index the 100 largest faces in the input image. If you're using version 4 or later of the face model, image orientation information is not returned in the <code>OrientationCorrection</code> field. To determine which version of the model you're using, call <a>DescribeCollection</a> and supply the collection ID. You can also get the model version from the value of <code>FaceModelVersion</code> in the response from <code>IndexFaces</code> For more information, see Model Versioning in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. If you provide the optional <code>ExternalImageId</code> for the input image you provided, Amazon Rekognition associates this ID with all faces that it detects. When you call the <a>ListFaces</a> operation, the response returns the external ID. You can use this external image ID to create a client-side index to associate the faces with each image. You can then use the index to find all faces in an image. You can specify the maximum number of faces to index with the <code>MaxFaces</code> input parameter. This is useful when you want to index the largest faces in an image and don't want to index smaller faces, such as those belonging to people standing in the background. The <code>QualityFilter</code> input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that donâ€™t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. By default, <code>IndexFaces</code> chooses the quality bar that's used to filter faces. You can also explicitly choose the quality bar. Use <code>QualityFilter</code>, to set the quality bar by specifying <code>LOW</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, or <code>HIGH</code>. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify <code>NONE</code>. <note> To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version 3 of the face model or higher. To get the version of the face model associated with a collection, call <a>DescribeCollection</a>. </note> Information about faces detected in an image, but not indexed, is returned in an array of <a>UnindexedFace</a> objects, <code>UnindexedFaces</code>. Faces aren't indexed for reasons such as: <ul> <li> The number of faces detected exceeds the value of the <code>MaxFaces</code> request parameter. </li> <li> The face is too small compared to the image dimensions. </li> <li> The face is too blurry. </li> <li> The image is too dark. </li> <li> The face has an extreme pose. </li> <li> The face doesnâ€™t have enough detail to be suitable for face search. </li> </ul> In response, the <code>IndexFaces</code> operation returns an array of metadata for all detected faces, <code>FaceRecords</code>. This includes: <ul> <li> The bounding box, <code>BoundingBox</code>, of the detected face. </li> <li> A confidence value, <code>Confidence</code>, which indicates the confidence that the bounding box contains a face. </li> <li> A face ID, <code>FaceId</code>, assigned by the service for each face that's detected and stored. </li> <li> An image ID, <code>ImageId</code>, assigned by the service for the input image. </li> </ul> If you request all facial attributes (by using the <code>detectionAttributes</code> parameter), Amazon Rekognition returns detailed facial attributes, such as facial landmarks (for example, location of eye and mouth) and other facial attributes. If you provide the same image, specify the same collection, and use the same external ID in the <code>IndexFaces</code> operation, Amazon Rekognition doesn't save duplicate face metadata. <p/> The input image is passed either as base64-encoded image bytes, or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file. This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:IndexFaces</code> action.

          Get the state for a routing control. A routing control is a simple on/off switch that you can use to route traffic to cells. When the state is On, traffic flows to a cell. When it's off, traffic does not flow. Before you can create a routing control, you first must create a cluster to host the control. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/recovery-cluster/latest/api/cluster.html">CreateCluster</a>. Access one of the endpoints for the cluster to get or update the routing control state to redirect traffic. For more information about working with routing controls, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.html">Routing control</a> in the Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.

Each cluster has a name, status, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), and an array of the five cluster endpoints (one for each supported Amazon Web Services Region) that you can use with API calls to the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller cluster data plane.

          Creates a new control panel. A control panel represents a group of routing controls that can be changed together in a single transaction. You can use a control panel to centrally view the operational status of applications across your organization, and trigger multi-app failovers in a single transaction, for example, to fail over an Availability Zone or AWS Region.

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Creates a safety rule in a control panel. Safety rules let you add safeguards around enabling and disabling routing controls, to help prevent unexpected outcomes. There are two types of safety rules: assertion rules and gating rules. Assertion rule: An assertion rule enforces that, when a routing control state is changed, the criteria set by the rule configuration is met. Otherwise, the change to the routing control is not accepted. Gating rule: A gating rule verifies that a set of gating controls evaluates as true, based on a rule configuration that you specify. If the gating rule evaluates to true, Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller allows a set of routing control state changes to run and complete against the set of target controls.

          Creates, changes, or deletes a resource record set, which contains authoritative DNS information for a specified domain name or subdomain name. For example, you can use <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code> to create a resource record set that routes traffic for test.example.com to a web server that has an IP address of 192.0.2.44. <b>Deleting Resource Record Sets</b> To delete a resource record set, you must specify all the same values that you specified when you created it. <b>Change Batches and Transactional Changes</b> The request body must include a document with a <code>ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest</code> element. The request body contains a list of change items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered transactional changes. Route 53 validates the changes in the request and then either makes all or none of the changes in the change batch request. This ensures that DNS routing isn't adversely affected by partial changes to the resource record sets in a hosted zone. For example, suppose a change batch request contains two changes: it deletes the <code>CNAME</code> resource record set for www.example.com and creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. If validation for both records succeeds, Route 53 deletes the first resource record set and creates the second resource record set in a single operation. If validation for either the <code>DELETE</code> or the <code>CREATE</code> action fails, then the request is canceled, and the original <code>CNAME</code> record continues to exist. <note> If you try to delete the same resource record set more than once in a single change batch, Route 53 returns an <code>InvalidChangeBatch</code> error. </note> <b>Traffic Flow</b> To create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use either the traffic flow visual editor in the Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save the configuration as a traffic policy, then associate the traffic policy with one or more domain names (such as example.com) or subdomain names (such as www.example.com), in the same hosted zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll back the updates if the new configuration isn't performing as expected. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/traffic-flow.html">Using Traffic Flow to Route DNS Traffic</a> in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i>. <b>Create, Delete, and Upsert</b> Use <code>ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest</code> to perform the following actions: <ul> <li> <code>CREATE</code>: Creates a resource record set that has the specified values. </li> <li> <code>DELETE</code>: Deletes an existing resource record set that has the specified values. </li> <li> <code>UPSERT</code>: If a resource record set does not already exist, Amazon Web Services creates it. If a resource set does exist, Route 53 updates it with the values in the request. </li> </ul> <b>Syntaxes for Creating, Updating, and Deleting Resource Record Sets</b> The syntax for a request depends on the type of resource record set that you want to create, delete, or update, such as weighted, alias, or failover. The XML elements in your request must appear in the order listed in the syntax. For an example for each type of resource record set, see "Examples." Don't refer to the syntax in the "Parameter Syntax" section, which includes all of the elements for every kind of resource record set that you can create, delete, or update by using <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code>. <b>Change Propagation to Route 53 DNS Servers</b> When you submit a <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code> request, Route 53 propagates your changes to all of the Route 53 authoritative DNS servers. While your changes are propagating, <code>GetChange</code> returns a status of <code>PENDING</code>. When propagation is complete, <code>GetChange</code> returns a status of <code>INSYNC</code>. Changes generally propagate to all Route 53 name servers within 60 seconds. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_GetChange.html">GetChange</a>. <b>Limits on ChangeResourceRecordSets Requests</b> For information about the limits on a <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code> request, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DNSLimitations.html">Limits</a> in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i>.

Note the following: <ul> <li> Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the health of an endpoint within a VPC by IP address, you must assign a public IP address to the instance in the VPC. </li> <li> You can configure a health checker to check the health of an external resource that the instance relies on, such as a database server. </li> <li> You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm with the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm. For example, you might create a CloudWatch metric that checks the status of the Amazon EC2 <code>StatusCheckFailed</code> metric, add an alarm to the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm.

You create records in a private hosted zone to define how you want to route traffic for a domain and its subdomains within one or more Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (Amazon VPCs). <important> You can't convert a public hosted zone to a private hosted zone or vice versa. Instead, you must create a new hosted zone with the same name and create new resource record sets. </important> For more information about charges for hosted zones, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/">Amazon Route 53 Pricing</a>. Note the following: <ul> <li> You can't create a hosted zone for a top-level domain (TLD) such as .com. </li> <li> For public hosted zones, Route 53 automatically creates a default SOA record and four NS records for the zone. For more information about SOA and NS records, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/SOA-NSrecords.html">NS and SOA Records that Route 53 Creates for a Hosted Zone</a> in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i>. If you want to use the same name servers for multiple public hosted zones, you can optionally associate a reusable delegation set with the hosted zone. See the <code>DelegationSetId</code> element. </li> <li> If your domain is registered with a registrar other than Route 53, you must update the name servers with your registrar to make Route 53 the DNS service for the domain.

          Creates a configuration for DNS query logging. After you create a query logging configuration, Amazon Route 53 begins to publish log data to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group. DNS query logs contain information about the queries that Route 53 receives for a specified public hosted zone, such as the following: <ul> <li> Route 53 edge location that responded to the DNS query </li> <li> Domain or subdomain that was requested </li> <li> DNS record type, such as A or AAAA </li> <li> DNS response code, such as <code>NoError</code> or <code>ServFail</code> </li> </ul> <dl> <dt>Log Group and Resource Policy</dt> <dd> Before you create a query logging configuration, perform the following operations. <note> If you create a query logging configuration using the Route 53 console, Route 53 performs these operations automatically. </note> <ol> <li> Create a CloudWatch Logs log group, and make note of the ARN, which you specify when you create a query logging configuration. Note the following: <ul> <li> You must create the log group in the us-east-1 region. </li> <li> You must use the same Amazon Web Services account to create the log group and the hosted zone that you want to configure query logging for. </li> <li> When you create log groups for query logging, we recommend that you use a consistent prefix, for example: <code>/aws/route53/<i>hosted zone name</i> </code> In the next step, you'll create a resource policy, which controls access to one or more log groups and the associated Amazon Web Services resources, such as Route 53 hosted zones. There's a limit on the number of resource policies that you can create, so we recommend that you use a consistent prefix so you can use the same resource policy for all the log groups that you create for query logging. </li> </ul> </li> <li> Create a CloudWatch Logs resource policy, and give it the permissions that Route 53 needs to create log streams and to send query logs to log streams. For the value of <code>Resource</code>, specify the ARN for the log group that you created in the previous step. To use the same resource policy for all the CloudWatch Logs log groups that you created for query logging configurations, replace the hosted zone name with <code>*</code>, for example: <code>arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123412341234:log-group:/aws/route53/*</code> <note> You can't use the CloudWatch console to create or edit a resource policy. You must use the CloudWatch API, one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs, or the CLI. </note> </li> </ol> </dd> <dt>Log Streams and Edge Locations</dt> <dd> When Route 53 finishes creating the configuration for DNS query logging, it does the following: <ul> <li> Creates a log stream for an edge location the first time that the edge location responds to DNS queries for the specified hosted zone. That log stream is used to log all queries that Route 53 responds to for that edge location. </li> <li> Begins to send query logs to the applicable log stream. </li> </ul> The name of each log stream is in the following format: <code> <i>hosted zone ID</i>/<i>edge location code</i> </code> The edge location code is a three-letter code and an arbitrarily assigned number, for example, DFW3. The three-letter code typically corresponds with the International Air Transport Association airport code for an airport near the edge location. (These abbreviations might change in the future.) For a list of edge locations, see "The Route 53 Global Network" on the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53/details/">Route 53 Product Details</a> page. </dd> <dt>Queries That Are Logged</dt> <dd> Query logs contain only the queries that DNS resolvers forward to Route 53. If a DNS resolver has already cached the response to a query (such as the IP address for a load balancer for example.com), the resolver will continue to return the cached response. It doesn't forward another query to Route 53 until the TTL for the corresponding resource record set expires. Depending on how many DNS queries are submitted for a resource record set, and depending on the TTL for that resource record set, query logs might contain information about only one query out of every several thousand queries that are submitted to DNS.

The process for migrating existing hosted zones to use a reusable delegation set is comparable to the process for configuring white label name servers. You need to perform the following steps: <ol> <li> Create a reusable delegation set. </li> <li> Recreate hosted zones, and reduce the TTL to 60 seconds or less. </li> <li> Recreate resource record sets in the new hosted zones. </li> <li> Change the registrar's name servers to use the name servers for the new hosted zones. </li> <li> Monitor traffic for the website or application. </li> <li> Change TTLs back to their original values. </li> </ol> If you want to migrate existing hosted zones to use a reusable delegation set, the existing hosted zones can't use any of the name servers that are assigned to the reusable delegation set. If one or more hosted zones do use one or more name servers that are assigned to the reusable delegation set, you can do one of the following: <ul> <li> For small numbers of hosted zonesâ€”up to a few hundredâ€”it's relatively easy to create reusable delegation sets until you get one that has four name servers that don't overlap with any of the name servers in your hosted zones. </li> <li> For larger numbers of hosted zones, the easiest solution is to use more than one reusable delegation set. </li> <li> For larger numbers of hosted zones, you can also migrate hosted zones that have overlapping name servers to hosted zones that don't have overlapping name servers, then migrate the hosted zones again to use the reusable delegation set. </li> </ul>

You must use the account that created the hosted zone to submit a <code>DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorization</code> request. <important> Sending this request only prevents the Amazon Web Services account that created the VPC from associating the VPC with the Amazon Route 53 hosted zone in the future. If the VPC is already associated with the hosted zone, <code>DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorization</code> won't disassociate the VPC from the hosted zone. If you want to delete an existing association, use <code>DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone</code>. </important>

          This operation registers a domain. Domains are registered either by Amazon Registrar (for .com, .net, and .org domains) or by our registrar associate, Gandi (for all other domains). For some top-level domains (TLDs), this operation requires extra parameters. When you register a domain, Amazon Route 53 does the following: <ul> <li> Creates a Route 53 hosted zone that has the same name as the domain. Route 53 assigns four name servers to your hosted zone and automatically updates your domain registration with the names of these name servers. </li> <li> Enables autorenew, so your domain registration will renew automatically each year. We'll notify you in advance of the renewal date so you can choose whether to renew the registration. </li> <li> Optionally enables privacy protection, so WHOIS queries return contact information either for Amazon Registrar (for .com, .net, and .org domains) or for our registrar associate, Gandi (for all other TLDs). If you don't enable privacy protection, WHOIS queries return the information that you entered for the registrant, admin, and tech contacts. </li> <li> If registration is successful, returns an operation ID that you can use to track the progress and completion of the action. If the request is not completed successfully, the domain registrant is notified by email. </li> <li> Charges your AWS account an amount based on the top-level domain.

          Transfers a domain from another registrar to Amazon Route 53. When the transfer is complete, the domain is registered either with Amazon Registrar (for .com, .net, and .org domains) or with our registrar associate, Gandi (for all other TLDs). For more information about transferring domains, see the following topics: <ul> <li> For transfer requirements, a detailed procedure, and information about viewing the status of a domain that you're transferring to Route 53, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-transfer-to-route-53.html">Transferring Registration for a Domain to Amazon Route 53</a> in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i>. </li> <li> For information about how to transfer a domain from one AWS account to another, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_domains_TransferDomainToAnotherAwsAccount.html">TransferDomainToAnotherAwsAccount</a>. </li> <li> For information about how to transfer a domain to another domain registrar, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-transfer-from-route-53.html">Transferring a Domain from Amazon Route 53 to Another Registrar</a> in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i>. </li> </ul> If the registrar for your domain is also the DNS service provider for the domain, we highly recommend that you transfer your DNS service to Route 53 or to another DNS service provider before you transfer your registration. Some registrars provide free DNS service when you purchase a domain registration. When you transfer the registration, the previous registrar will not renew your domain registration and could end your DNS service at any time. <important> If the registrar for your domain is also the DNS service provider for the domain and you don't transfer DNS service to another provider, your website, email, and the web applications associated with the domain might become unavailable. </important> If the transfer is successful, this method returns an operation ID that you can use to track the progress and completion of the action.

          Transfers a domain from the current AWS account to another AWS account. Note the following: <ul> <li> The AWS account that you're transferring the domain to must accept the transfer.

          Creates a Resolver query logging configuration, which defines where you want Resolver to save DNS query logs that originate in your VPCs. Resolver can log queries only for VPCs that are in the same Region as the query logging configuration. To specify which VPCs you want to log queries for, you use <code>AssociateResolverQueryLogConfig</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_AssociateResolverQueryLogConfig.html">AssociateResolverQueryLogConfig</a>. You can optionally use Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share a query logging configuration with other Amazon Web Services accounts. The other accounts can then associate VPCs with the configuration. The query logs that Resolver creates for a configuration include all DNS queries that originate in all VPCs that are associated with the configuration.

          Deletes a query logging configuration. When you delete a configuration, Resolver stops logging DNS queries for all of the Amazon VPCs that are associated with the configuration. This also applies if the query logging configuration is shared with other Amazon Web Services accounts, and the other accounts have associated VPCs with the shared configuration. Before you can delete a query logging configuration, you must first disassociate all VPCs from the configuration. See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_DisassociateResolverQueryLogConfig.html">DisassociateResolverQueryLogConfig</a>. If you used Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share a query logging configuration with other accounts, you must stop sharing the configuration before you can delete a configuration. The accounts that you shared the configuration with can first disassociate VPCs that they associated with the configuration, but that's not necessary. If you stop sharing the configuration, those VPCs are automatically disassociated from the configuration.

          This action aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be freed. However, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary to abort a given multipart upload multiple times in order to completely free all storage consumed by all parts. To verify that all parts have been removed, so you don't get charged for the part storage, you should call the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListParts.html">ListParts</a> action and ensure that the parts list is empty.

          Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts. You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html">UploadPart</a> operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call this action to complete the upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object. In the Complete Multipart Upload request, you must provide the parts list. You must ensure that the parts list is complete. This action concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in the list, you must provide the part number and the <code>ETag</code> value, returned after that part was uploaded. Processing of a Complete Multipart Upload request could take several minutes to complete. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that specifies a 200 OK response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white space characters to keep the connection from timing out. Because a request could fail after the initial 200 OK response has been sent, it is important that you check the response body to determine whether the request succeeded. Note that if <code>CompleteMultipartUpload</code> fails, applications should be prepared to retry the failed requests.

          Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3. <note> You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic action using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy API. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html">Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API</a>. </note> All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have <i>read</i> access to the source object and <i>write</i> access to the destination bucket. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html">REST Authentication</a>. Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account. A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy action starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the <code>200 OK</code> response. This means that a <code>200 OK</code> response can contain either a success or an error. Design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object. <note> If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. If it were not, it would not contain the content-length, and you would need to read the entire body. </note> The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that you specify for the destination object. For pricing information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/">Amazon S3 pricing</a>. <important> Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If you request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a 400 <code>Bad Request</code> error. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html">Transfer Acceleration</a>. </important> <b>Metadata</b> When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html">Using ACLs</a>. To specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the source object or replaced with metadata provided in the request, you can optionally add the <code>x-amz-metadata-directive</code> header. When you grant permissions, you can use the <code>s3:x-amz-metadata-directive</code> condition key to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/amazon-s3-policy-keys.html">Specifying Conditions in a Policy</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. For a complete list of Amazon S3-specific condition keys, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/list_amazons3.html">Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3</a>. <b> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if</code> Headers</b> To only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the <code>Etag</code> matches or whether the object was modified before or after a specified date, use the following request parameters: <ul> <li> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-match</code> </li> <li> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match</code> </li> <li> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since</code> </li> <li> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since</code> </li> </ul> If both the <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-match</code> and <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since</code> headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns <code>200 OK</code> and copies the data: <ul> <li> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-match</code> condition evaluates to true </li> <li> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since</code> condition evaluates to false </li> </ul> If both the <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match</code> and <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since</code> headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the <code>412 Precondition Failed</code> response code: <ul> <li> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match</code> condition evaluates to false </li> <li> <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since</code> condition evaluates to true </li> </ul> <note> All headers with the <code>x-amz-</code> prefix, including <code>x-amz-copy-source</code>, must be signed. </note> <b>Server-side encryption</b> When you perform a CopyObject operation, you can optionally use the appropriate encryption-related headers to encrypt the object using server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) or a customer-provided encryption key. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. For more information about server-side encryption, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html">Using Server-Side Encryption</a>. If a target object uses SSE-KMS, you can enable an S3 Bucket Key for the object. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html">Amazon S3 Bucket Keys</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. <b>Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers</b> When copying an object, you can optionally use headers to grant ACL-based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html">Managing ACLs Using the REST API</a>. <b>Storage Class Options</b> You can use the <code>CopyObject</code> action to change the storage class of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3 using the <code>StorageClass</code> parameter. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html">Storage Classes</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. <b>Versioning</b> By default, <code>x-amz-copy-source</code> identifies the current version of an object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use the <code>versionId</code> subresource. If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the <code>x-amz-version-id</code> response header in the response. If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null. If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy of this object before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html">RestoreObject</a>.

          Creates a new S3 bucket. To create a bucket, you must register with Amazon S3 and have a valid Amazon Web Services Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner. Not every string is an acceptable bucket name. For information about bucket naming restrictions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html">Bucket naming rules</a>. If you want to create an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_CreateBucket.html">Create Bucket</a>. By default, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You can optionally specify a Region in the request body. You might choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside in Europe, you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the Europe (Ireland) Region. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro">Accessing a bucket</a>. <note> If you send your create bucket request to the <code>s3.amazonaws.com</code> endpoint, the request goes to the us-east-1 Region. Accordingly, the signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must use us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location constraint in the request specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html">Virtual hosting of buckets</a>. </note> When creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the bucket. There are two ways to grant the appropriate permissions using the request headers. <ul> <li> Specify a canned ACL using the <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as <i>canned ACLs</i>. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned ACL</a>. </li> <li> Specify access permissions explicitly using the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. These headers map to the set of permissions Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access control list (ACL) overview</a>. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following: <ul> <li> <code>id</code> â€“ if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account </li> <li> <code>uri</code> â€“ if you are granting permissions to a predefined group </li> <li> <code>emailAddress</code> â€“ if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account <note> Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions: <ul> <li> US East (N. Virginia) </li> <li> US West (N. California) </li> <li> US West (Oregon) </li> <li> Asia Pacific (Singapore) </li> <li> Asia Pacific (Sydney) </li> <li> Asia Pacific (Tokyo) </li> <li> Europe (Ireland) </li> <li> South America (SÃ£o Paulo) </li> </ul> For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region">Regions and Endpoints</a> in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. </note> </li> </ul> For example, the following <code>x-amz-grant-read</code> header grants the Amazon Web Services accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata: <code>x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666" </code> </li> </ul> <note> You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both. </note> <b>Permissions</b> If your <code>CreateBucket</code> request specifies ACL permissions and the ACL is public-read, public-read-write, authenticated-read, or if you specify access permissions explicitly through any other ACL, both <code>s3:CreateBucket</code> and <code>s3:PutBucketAcl</code> permissions are needed. If the ACL the <code>CreateBucket</code> request is private, only <code>s3:CreateBucket</code> permission is needed. If <code>ObjectLockEnabledForBucket</code> is set to true in your <code>CreateBucket</code> request, <code>s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration</code> and <code>s3:PutBucketVersioning</code> permissions are required.

          This action initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html">UploadPart</a>). You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request. For more information about multipart uploads, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html">Multipart Upload Overview</a>. If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the upload must complete within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort action and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config">Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy</a>. For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html">Multipart Upload and Permissions</a>. For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)</a>. <note> After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload. </note> You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use Amazon Web Services KMS keys or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html">UploadPart</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html">UploadPartCopy</a> requests must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using <code>CreateMultipartUpload</code>. To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an Amazon Web Services KMS key, the requester must have permission to the <code>kms:Decrypt</code> and <code>kms:GenerateDataKey*</code> actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions">Multipart upload API and permissions</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. If your Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same Amazon Web Services account as the KMS key, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs to a different account than the key, then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.

          Removes the null version (if there is one) of an object and inserts a delete marker, which becomes the latest version of the object. If there isn't a null version, Amazon S3 does not remove any objects but will still respond that the command was successful. To remove a specific version, you must be the bucket owner and you must use the version Id subresource. Using this subresource permanently deletes the version. If the object deleted is a delete marker, Amazon S3 sets the response header, <code>x-amz-delete-marker</code>, to true. If the object you want to delete is in a bucket where the bucket versioning configuration is MFA Delete enabled, you must include the <code>x-amz-mfa</code> request header in the DELETE <code>versionId</code> request. Requests that include <code>x-amz-mfa</code> must use HTTPS. For more information about MFA Delete, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMFADelete.html">Using MFA Delete</a>. To see sample requests that use versioning, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectDELETE.html#ExampleVersionObjectDelete">Sample Request</a>. You can delete objects by explicitly calling DELETE Object or configure its lifecycle (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycle.html">PutBucketLifecycle</a>) to enable Amazon S3 to remove them for you. If you want to block users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them the <code>s3:DeleteObject</code>, <code>s3:DeleteObjectVersion</code>, and <code>s3:PutLifeCycleConfiguration</code> actions. The following action is related to <code>DeleteObject</code>: <ul> <li> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html">PutObject</a> </li> </ul>

          This action enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this action provides a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead. The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete action and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in the response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted. The action supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the action uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete action encountered an error. For a successful deletion, the action does not return any information about the delete in the response body. When performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete"> MFA Delete</a>. Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests. Amazon S3 uses the header value to ensure that your request body has not been altered in transit.

          Gets the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration from the specified bucket. The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in two low latency and high throughput access tiers. For data that can be accessed asynchronously, you can choose to activate automatic archiving capabilities within the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

          Retrieves objects from Amazon S3. To use <code>GET</code>, you must have <code>READ</code> access to the object. If you grant <code>READ</code> access to the anonymous user, you can return the object without using an authorization header. An Amazon S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find in a typical computer file system. You can, however, create a logical hierarchy by using object key names that imply a folder structure. For example, instead of naming an object <code>sample.jpg</code>, you can name it <code>photos/2006/February/sample.jpg</code>. To get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key name for the object in the <code>GET</code> operation. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object <code>photos/2006/February/sample.jpg</code>, specify the resource as <code>/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg</code>. For a path-style request example, if you have the object <code>photos/2006/February/sample.jpg</code> in the bucket named <code>examplebucket</code>, specify the resource as <code>/examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg</code>. For more information about request types, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html#VirtualHostingSpecifyBucket">HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification</a>. To distribute large files to many people, you can save bandwidth costs by using BitTorrent. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3Torrent.html">Amazon S3 Torrent</a>. For more information about returning the ACL of an object, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAcl.html">GetObjectAcl</a>. If the object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html">RestoreObject</a>. Otherwise, this action returns an <code>InvalidObjectStateError</code> error. For information about restoring archived objects, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html">Restoring Archived Objects</a>. Encryption request headers, like <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption</code>, should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3â€“managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of keys, youâ€™ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error. If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following headers: <ul> <li> x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm </li> <li> x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key </li> <li> x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5 </li> </ul> For more information about SSE-C, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html">Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys)</a>. Assuming you have the relevant permission to read object tags, the response also returns the <code>x-amz-tagging-count</code> header that provides the count of number of tags associated with the object. You can use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectTagging.html">GetObjectTagging</a> to retrieve the tag set associated with an object. <b>Permissions</b> You need the relevant read object (or version) permission for this operation. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html">Specifying Permissions in a Policy</a>. If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the <code>s3:ListBucket</code> permission. <ul> <li> If you have the <code>s3:ListBucket</code> permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 404 ("no such key") error. </li> <li> If you donâ€™t have the <code>s3:ListBucket</code> permission, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 403 ("access denied") error. </li> </ul> <b>Versioning</b> By default, the GET action returns the current version of an object. To return a different version, use the <code>versionId</code> subresource. <note> <ul> <li> You need the <code>s3:GetObjectVersion</code> permission to access a specific version of an object. </li> <li> If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted and includes <code>x-amz-delete-marker: true</code> in the response. </li> </ul> </note> For more information about versioning, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketVersioning.html">PutBucketVersioning</a>. <b>Overriding Response Header Values</b> There are times when you want to override certain response header values in a GET response. For example, you might override the Content-Disposition response header value in your GET request. You can override values for a set of response headers using the following query parameters. These response header values are sent only on a successful request, that is, when status code 200 OK is returned. The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The response headers that you can override for the GET response are <code>Content-Type</code>, <code>Content-Language</code>, <code>Expires</code>, <code>Cache-Control</code>, <code>Content-Disposition</code>, and <code>Content-Encoding</code>. To override these header values in the GET response, you use the following request parameters. <note> You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a presigned URL, when using these parameters. They cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request. </note> <ul> <li> <code>response-content-type</code> </li> <li> <code>response-content-language</code> </li> <li> <code>response-expires</code> </li> <li> <code>response-cache-control</code> </li> <li> <code>response-content-disposition</code> </li> <li> <code>response-content-encoding</code> </li> </ul> <b>Additional Considerations about Request Headers</b> If both of the <code>If-Match</code> and <code>If-Unmodified-Since</code> headers are present in the request as follows: <code>If-Match</code> condition evaluates to <code>true</code>, and; <code>If-Unmodified-Since</code> condition evaluates to <code>false</code>; then, S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested. If both of the <code>If-None-Match</code> and <code>If-Modified-Since</code> headers are present in the request as follows:<code> If-None-Match</code> condition evaluates to <code>false</code>, and; <code>If-Modified-Since</code> condition evaluates to <code>true</code>; then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified response code.

          The HEAD action retrieves metadata from an object without returning the object itself. This action is useful if you're only interested in an object's metadata. To use HEAD, you must have READ access to the object. A <code>HEAD</code> request has the same options as a <code>GET</code> action on an object. The response is identical to the <code>GET</code> response except that there is no response body. Because of this, if the <code>HEAD</code> request generates an error, it returns a generic <code>404 Not Found</code> or <code>403 Forbidden</code> code. It is not possible to retrieve the exact exception beyond these error codes. If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers: <ul> <li> x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm </li> <li> x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key </li> <li> x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5 </li> </ul> For more information about SSE-C, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html">Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys)</a>. <note> <ul> <li> Encryption request headers, like <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption</code>, should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3â€“managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of keys, youâ€™ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error. </li> <li> The last modified property in this case is the creation date of the object. </li> </ul> </note> Request headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTCommonRequestHeaders.html">Common Request Headers</a>. Consider the following when using request headers: <ul> <li> Consideration 1 â€“ If both of the <code>If-Match</code> and <code>If-Unmodified-Since</code> headers are present in the request as follows: <ul> <li> <code>If-Match</code> condition evaluates to <code>true</code>, and; </li> <li> <code>If-Unmodified-Since</code> condition evaluates to <code>false</code>; </li> </ul> Then Amazon S3 returns <code>200 OK</code> and the data requested. </li> <li> Consideration 2 â€“ If both of the <code>If-None-Match</code> and <code>If-Modified-Since</code> headers are present in the request as follows: <ul> <li> <code>If-None-Match</code> condition evaluates to <code>false</code>, and; </li> <li> <code>If-Modified-Since</code> condition evaluates to <code>true</code>; </li> </ul> Then Amazon S3 returns the <code>304 Not Modified</code> response code. </li> </ul> For more information about conditional requests, see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232">RFC 7232</a>. <b>Permissions</b> You need the relevant read object (or version) permission for this operation. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html">Specifying Permissions in a Policy</a>. If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission. <ul> <li> If you have the <code>s3:ListBucket</code> permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 404 ("no such key") error. </li> <li> If you donâ€™t have the <code>s3:ListBucket</code> permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 403 ("access denied") error. </li> </ul> The following action is related to <code>HeadObject</code>: <ul> <li> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html">GetObject</a> </li> </ul>

          Lists the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration from the specified bucket. The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in two low latency and high throughput access tiers. For data that can be accessed asynchronously, you can choose to activate automatic archiving capabilities within the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

          Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to it. Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket. Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you need this, make sure to build it into your application layer or use versioning instead. To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the <code>Content-MD5</code> header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value. <note> <ul> <li> To successfully complete the <code>PutObject</code> request, you must have the <code>s3:PutObject</code> in your IAM permissions. </li> <li> To successfully change the objects acl of your <code>PutObject</code> request, you must have the <code>s3:PutObjectAcl</code> in your IAM permissions. </li> <li> The <code>Content-MD5</code> header is required for any request to upload an object with a retention period configured using Amazon S3 Object Lock. For more information about Amazon S3 Object Lock, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock-overview.html">Amazon S3 Object Lock Overview</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. </li> </ul> </note> <b>Server-side Encryption</b> You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. You have the option to provide your own encryption key or use Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS). For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html">Using Server-Side Encryption</a>. If you request server-side encryption using Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (SSE-KMS), you can enable an S3 Bucket Key at the object-level. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html">Amazon S3 Bucket Keys</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. <b>Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers</b> You can use headers to grant ACL- based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html">Managing ACLs Using the REST API</a>. <b>Storage Class Options</b> By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS Storage Class.

          Uses the <code>acl</code> subresource to set the access control list (ACL) permissions for a new or existing object in an S3 bucket. You must have <code>WRITE_ACP</code> permission to set the ACL of an object. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#permissions">What permissions can I grant?</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts. Depending on your application needs, you can choose to set the ACL on an object using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, you can continue to use that approach. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. <b>Access Permissions</b> You can set access permissions using one of the following methods: <ul> <li> Specify a canned ACL with the <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of <code>x-amz-ac</code>l. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned ACL</a>. </li> <li> Specify access permissions explicitly with the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use <code>x-amz-acl</code> header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following: <ul> <li> <code>id</code> â€“ if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account </li> <li> <code>uri</code> â€“ if you are granting permissions to a predefined group </li> <li> <code>emailAddress</code> â€“ if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account <note> Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions: <ul> <li> US East (N. Virginia) </li> <li> US West (N. California) </li> <li> US West (Oregon) </li> <li> Asia Pacific (Singapore) </li> <li> Asia Pacific (Sydney) </li> <li> Asia Pacific (Tokyo) </li> <li> Europe (Ireland) </li> <li> South America (SÃ£o Paulo) </li> </ul> For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region">Regions and Endpoints</a> in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. </note> </li> </ul> For example, the following <code>x-amz-grant-read</code> header grants list objects permission to the two Amazon Web Services accounts identified by their email addresses. <code>x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com" </code> </li> </ul> You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both. <b>Grantee Values</b> You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways: <ul> <li> By the person's ID: <code>&lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="CanonicalUser"&gt;&lt;ID&gt;&lt;&gt;ID&lt;&gt;&lt;/ID&gt;&lt;DisplayName&gt;&lt;&gt;GranteesEmail&lt;&gt;&lt;/DisplayName&gt; &lt;/Grantee&gt;</code> DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request. </li> <li> By URI: <code>&lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="Group"&gt;&lt;URI&gt;&lt;&gt;http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers&lt;&gt;&lt;/URI&gt;&lt;/Grantee&gt;</code> </li> <li> By Email address: <code>&lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"&gt;&lt;EmailAddress&gt;&lt;&gt;Grantees@email.com&lt;&gt;&lt;/EmailAddress&gt;lt;/Grantee&gt;</code> The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser. <note> Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions: <ul> <li> US East (N. Virginia) </li> <li> US West (N.

          Restores an archived copy of an object back into Amazon S3 This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts. This action performs the following types of requests: <ul> <li> <code>select</code> - Perform a select query on an archived object </li> <li> <code>restore an archive</code> - Restore an archived object </li> </ul> To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the <code>s3:RestoreObject</code> action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources">Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html">Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. <b>Querying Archives with Select Requests</b> You use a select type of request to perform SQL queries on archived objects. The archived objects that are being queried by the select request must be formatted as uncompressed comma-separated values (CSV) files. You can run queries and custom analytics on your archived data without having to restore your data to a hotter Amazon S3 tier. For an overview about select requests, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html">Querying Archived Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. When making a select request, do the following: <ul> <li> Define an output location for the select query's output. This must be an Amazon S3 bucket in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the bucket that contains the archive object that is being queried. The Amazon Web Services account that initiates the job must have permissions to write to the S3 bucket. You can specify the storage class and encryption for the output objects stored in the bucket. For more information about output, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html">Querying Archived Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. For more information about the <code>S3</code> structure in the request body, see the following: <ul> <li> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html">PutObject</a> </li> <li> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html">Managing Access with ACLs</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i> </li> <li> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i> </li> </ul> </li> <li> Define the SQL expression for the <code>SELECT</code> type of restoration for your query in the request body's <code>SelectParameters</code> structure. You can use expressions like the following examples. <ul> <li> The following expression returns all records from the specified object. <code>SELECT * FROM Object</code> </li> <li> Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in the object, you can specify columns with positional headers. <code>SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 &gt; 100</code> </li> <li> If you have headers and you set the <code>fileHeaderInfo</code> in the <code>CSV</code> structure in the request body to <code>USE</code>, you can specify headers in the query. (If you set the <code>fileHeaderInfo</code> field to <code>IGNORE</code>, the first row is skipped for the query.) You cannot mix ordinal positions with header column names. <code>SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN FROM S3Object s</code> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> For more information about using SQL with S3 Glacier Select restore, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-glacier-select-sql-reference.html">SQL Reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. When making a select request, you can also do the following: <ul> <li> To expedite your queries, specify the <code>Expedited</code> tier. For more information about tiers, see "Restoring Archives," later in this topic. </li> <li> Specify details about the data serialization format of both the input object that is being queried and the serialization of the CSV-encoded query results. </li> </ul> The following are additional important facts about the select feature: <ul> <li> The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive retrievals, they are stored until explicitly deleted-manually or through a lifecycle policy. </li> <li> You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3 object. Amazon S3 doesn't deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing duplicate requests. </li> <li> Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already been restored. A select request doesnâ€™t return error response <code>409</code>. </li> </ul> <b>Restoring objects</b> Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers are not accessible in real time. For objects in Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier. For objects in S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is available. To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify. To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version. When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the <code>Tier</code> element of the request body: <ul> <li> <b> <code>Expedited</code> </b> - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1â€“5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. </li> <li> <b> <code>Standard</code> </b> - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3â€“5 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. </li> <li> <b> <code>Bulk</code> </b> - Bulk retrievals are the lowest-cost retrieval option in S3 Glacier, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5â€“12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. </li> </ul> For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for <code>Expedited</code> data access, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html">Restoring Archived Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html"> Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <code>HEAD</code> request. Operations return the <code>x-amz-restore</code> header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html">Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object. If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html">PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html">Object Lifecycle Management</a> in <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. <b>Responses</b> A successful action returns either the <code>200 OK</code> or <code>202 Accepted</code> status code. <ul> <li> If the object is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns <code>202 Accepted</code> in the response. </li> <li> If the object is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns <code>200 OK</code> in the response. </li> </ul> <p class="title"> <b>Special Errors</b> <ul> <li> <ul> <li> <i>Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress</i> </li> <li> <i>Cause: Object restore is already in progress.

          This action filters the contents of an Amazon S3 object based on a simple structured query language (SQL) statement. In the request, along with the SQL expression, you must also specify a data serialization format (JSON, CSV, or Apache Parquet) of the object. Amazon S3 uses this format to parse object data into records, and returns only records that match the specified SQL expression. You must also specify the data serialization format for the response.

          Uploads a part in a multipart upload. <note> In this operation, you provide part data in your request. However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html">UploadPartCopy</a> operation. </note> You must initiate a multipart upload (see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html">CreateMultipartUpload</a>) before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must include in your upload part request. Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload. To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the <code>Content-MD5</code> header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error. If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then Amazon Web Services S3 uses the <code>x-amz-content-sha256</code> header as a checksum instead of <code>Content-MD5</code>. For more information see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.html">Authenticating Requests: Using the Authorization Header (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)</a>. <b>Note:</b> After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage. For more information on multipart uploads, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html">Multipart Upload Overview</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide </i>. For information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html">Multipart Upload and Permissions</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. You can optionally request server-side encryption where Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it. You have the option of providing your own encryption key, or you can use the Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in the request must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html">CreateMultipartUpload</a>. For more information, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html">Using Server-Side Encryption</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload actions. Unless you are using a customer-provided encryption key, you don't need to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart request. Instead, you only need to specify the server-side encryption parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html">CreateMultipartUpload</a>. If you requested server-side encryption using a customer-provided encryption key in your initiate multipart upload request, you must provide identical encryption information in each part upload using the following headers. <ul> <li> x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm </li> <li> x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key </li> <li> x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5 </li> </ul> <p class="title"> <b>Special Errors</b> <ul> <li> <ul> <li> <i>Code: NoSuchUpload</i> </li> <li> <i>Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist.

          Uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as data source. You specify the data source by adding the request header <code>x-amz-copy-source</code> in your request and a byte range by adding the request header <code>x-amz-copy-source-range</code> in your request. The minimum allowable part size for a multipart upload is 5 MB. For more information about multipart upload limits, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/qfacts.html">Quick Facts</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. <note> Instead of using an existing object as part data, you might use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html">UploadPart</a> action and provide data in your request. </note> You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request. Amazon S3 returns a unique identifier, the upload ID, that you must include in your upload part request. For more information about using the <code>UploadPartCopy</code> operation, see the following: <ul> <li> For conceptual information about multipart uploads, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html">Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. </li> <li> For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html">Multipart Upload and Permissions</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. </li> <li> For information about copying objects using a single atomic action vs. the multipart upload, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectOperations.html">Operations on Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. </li> <li> For information about using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys with the UploadPartCopy operation, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html">CopyObject</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html">UploadPart</a>. </li> </ul> Note the following additional considerations about the request headers <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-match</code>, <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match</code>, <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since</code>, and <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since</code>: <ul> <li> <b>Consideration 1</b> - If both of the <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-match</code> and <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since</code> headers are present in the request as follows: <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-match</code> condition evaluates to <code>true</code>, and; <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since</code> condition evaluates to <code>false</code>; Amazon S3 returns <code>200 OK</code> and copies the data. </li> <li> <b>Consideration 2</b> - If both of the <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match</code> and <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since</code> headers are present in the request as follows: <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match</code> condition evaluates to <code>false</code>, and; <code>x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since</code> condition evaluates to <code>true</code>; Amazon S3 returns <code>412 Precondition Failed</code> response code. </li> </ul> <b>Versioning</b> If your bucket has versioning enabled, you could have multiple versions of the same object. By default, <code>x-amz-copy-source</code> identifies the current version of the object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker and you don't specify a versionId in the <code>x-amz-copy-source</code>, Amazon S3 returns a 404 error, because the object does not exist. If you specify versionId in the <code>x-amz-copy-source</code> and the versionId is a delete marker, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP 400 error, because you are not allowed to specify a delete marker as a version for the <code>x-amz-copy-source</code>.

          After you deploy a model into production using Amazon SageMaker hosting services, your client applications use this API to get inferences from the model hosted at the specified endpoint. For an overview of Amazon SageMaker, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works.html">How It Works</a>. Amazon SageMaker strips all POST headers except those supported by the API. Amazon SageMaker might add additional headers. You should not rely on the behavior of headers outside those enumerated in the request syntax. Calls to <code>InvokeEndpoint</code> are authenticated by using AWS Signature Version 4. For information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating Requests (AWS Signature Version 4)</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 API Reference</i>. A customer's model containers must respond to requests within 60 seconds. The model itself can have a maximum processing time of 60 seconds before responding to invocations. If your model is going to take 50-60 seconds of processing time, the SDK socket timeout should be set to be 70 seconds. <note> Endpoints are scoped to an individual account, and are not public. The URL does not contain the account ID, but Amazon SageMaker determines the account ID from the authentication token that is supplied by the caller. </note>

A domain consists of an associated Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) volume, a list of authorized users, and a variety of security, application, policy, and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configurations. An Amazon Web Services account is limited to one domain per region. Users within a domain can share notebook files and other artifacts with each other. <b>EFS storage</b> When a domain is created, an EFS volume is created for use by all of the users within the domain. Each user receives a private home directory within the EFS volume for notebooks, Git repositories, and data files. SageMaker uses the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) to encrypt the EFS volume attached to the domain with an Amazon Web Services managed key by default. For more control, you can specify a customer managed key. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/encryption-at-rest.html">Protect Data at Rest Using Encryption</a>. <b>VPC configuration</b> All SageMaker Studio traffic between the domain and the EFS volume is through the specified VPC and subnets. For other Studio traffic, you can specify the <code>AppNetworkAccessType</code> parameter. <code>AppNetworkAccessType</code> corresponds to the network access type that you choose when you onboard to Studio. The following options are available: <ul> <li> <code>PublicInternetOnly</code> - Non-EFS traffic goes through a VPC managed by Amazon SageMaker, which allows internet access. This is the default value. </li> <li> <code>VpcOnly</code> - All Studio traffic is through the specified VPC and subnets. Internet access is disabled by default. To allow internet access, you must specify a NAT gateway. When internet access is disabled, you won't be able to run a Studio notebook or to train or host models unless your VPC has an interface endpoint to the SageMaker API and runtime or a NAT gateway and your security groups allow outbound connections. </li> </ul> <important> NFS traffic over TCP on port 2049 needs to be allowed in both inbound and outbound rules in order to launch a SageMaker Studio app successfully. </important> For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-notebooks-and-internet-access.html">Connect SageMaker Studio Notebooks to Resources in a VPC</a>.

          Creates an endpoint using the endpoint configuration specified in the request. Amazon SageMaker uses the endpoint to provision resources and deploy models. You create the endpoint configuration with the <a>CreateEndpointConfig</a> API. Use this API to deploy models using Amazon SageMaker hosting services. For an example that calls this method when deploying a model to Amazon SageMaker hosting services, see the <a href="https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/sagemaker-fundamentals/create-endpoint/create_endpoint.ipynb">Create Endpoint example notebook.</a> <note> You must not delete an <code>EndpointConfig</code> that is in use by an endpoint that is live or while the <code>UpdateEndpoint</code> or <code>CreateEndpoint</code> operations are being performed on the endpoint. To update an endpoint, you must create a new <code>EndpointConfig</code>. </note> The endpoint name must be unique within an Amazon Web Services Region in your Amazon Web Services account. When it receives the request, Amazon SageMaker creates the endpoint, launches the resources (ML compute instances), and deploys the model(s) on them. <note> When you call <a>CreateEndpoint</a>, a load call is made to DynamoDB to verify that your endpoint configuration exists. When you read data from a DynamoDB table supporting <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadConsistency.html"> <code>Eventually Consistent Reads</code> </a>, the response might not reflect the results of a recently completed write operation. The response might include some stale data. If the dependent entities are not yet in DynamoDB, this causes a validation error. If you repeat your read request after a short time, the response should return the latest data. So retry logic is recommended to handle these possible issues. We also recommend that customers call <a>DescribeEndpointConfig</a> before calling <a>CreateEndpoint</a> to minimize the potential impact of a DynamoDB eventually consistent read. </note> When Amazon SageMaker receives the request, it sets the endpoint status to <code>Creating</code>. After it creates the endpoint, it sets the status to <code>InService</code>. Amazon SageMaker can then process incoming requests for inferences. To check the status of an endpoint, use the <a>DescribeEndpoint</a> API. If any of the models hosted at this endpoint get model data from an Amazon S3 location, Amazon SageMaker uses Amazon Web Services Security Token Service to download model artifacts from the S3 path you provided. Amazon Web Services STS is activated in your IAM user account by default. If you previously deactivated Amazon Web Services STS for a region, you need to reactivate Amazon Web Services STS for that region. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html">Activating and Deactivating Amazon Web Services STS in an Amazon Web Services Region</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management User Guide</i>. <note> To add the IAM role policies for using this API operation, go to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/">IAM console</a>, and choose Roles in the left navigation pane. Search the IAM role that you want to grant access to use the <a>CreateEndpoint</a> and <a>CreateEndpointConfig</a> API operations, add the following policies to the role. <ul> <li> Option 1: For a full SageMaker access, search and attach the <code>AmazonSageMakerFullAccess</code> policy. </li> <li> Option 2: For granting a limited access to an IAM role, paste the following Action elements manually into the JSON file of the IAM role: <code>"Action": ["sagemaker:CreateEndpoint", "sagemaker:CreateEndpointConfig"]</code> <code>"Resource": [</code> <code>"arn:aws:sagemaker:region:account-id:endpoint/endpointName"</code> <code>"arn:aws:sagemaker:region:account-id:endpoint-config/endpointConfigName"</code> <code>]</code> For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/api-permissions-reference.html">SageMaker API Permissions: Actions, Permissions, and Resources Reference</a>. </li> </ul> </note>

Use a private workforce when want the data to stay within your organization or when a specific set of skills is required. </li> <li> One or more vendors that you select from the Amazon Web Services Marketplace. Vendors provide expertise in specific areas. </li> <li> The Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce. This is the largest workforce, but it should only be used for public data or data that has been stripped of any personally identifiable information. </li> </ul> You can also use <i>automated data labeling</i> to reduce the number of data objects that need to be labeled by a human. Automated data labeling uses <i>active learning</i> to determine if a data object can be labeled by machine or if it needs to be sent to a human worker. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-automated-labeling.html">Using Automated Data Labeling</a>. The data objects to be labeled are contained in an Amazon S3 bucket. You create a <i>manifest file</i> that describes the location of each object. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-data.html">Using Input and Output Data</a>. The output can be used as the manifest file for another labeling job or as training data for your machine learning models. You can use this operation to create a static labeling job or a streaming labeling job. A static labeling job stops if all data objects in the input manifest file identified in <code>ManifestS3Uri</code> have been labeled. A streaming labeling job runs perpetually until it is manually stopped, or remains idle for 10 days. You can send new data objects to an active (<code>InProgress</code>) streaming labeling job in real time. To learn how to create a static labeling job, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-create-labeling-job-api.html">Create a Labeling Job (API) </a> in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.

          Creates a model in Amazon SageMaker. In the request, you name the model and describe a primary container. For the primary container, you specify the Docker image that contains inference code, artifacts (from prior training), and a custom environment map that the inference code uses when you deploy the model for predictions. Use this API to create a model if you want to use Amazon SageMaker hosting services or run a batch transform job. To host your model, you create an endpoint configuration with the <code>CreateEndpointConfig</code> API, and then create an endpoint with the <code>CreateEndpoint</code> API. Amazon SageMaker then deploys all of the containers that you defined for the model in the hosting environment. For an example that calls this method when deploying a model to Amazon SageMaker hosting services, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ex1-deploy-model.html#ex1-deploy-model-boto">Deploy the Model to Amazon SageMaker Hosting Services (Amazon Web Services SDK for Python (Boto 3)).</a> To run a batch transform using your model, you start a job with the <code>CreateTransformJob</code> API. Amazon SageMaker uses your model and your dataset to get inferences which are then saved to a specified S3 location. In the <code>CreateModel</code> request, you must define a container with the <code>PrimaryContainer</code> parameter. In the request, you also provide an IAM role that Amazon SageMaker can assume to access model artifacts and docker image for deployment on ML compute hosting instances or for batch transform jobs. In addition, you also use the IAM role to manage permissions the inference code needs. For example, if the inference code access any other Amazon Web Services resources, you grant necessary permissions via this role.

In a <code>CreateNotebookInstance</code> request, specify the type of ML compute instance that you want to run. Amazon SageMaker launches the instance, installs common libraries that you can use to explore datasets for model training, and attaches an ML storage volume to the notebook instance. Amazon SageMaker also provides a set of example notebooks. Each notebook demonstrates how to use Amazon SageMaker with a specific algorithm or with a machine learning framework. After receiving the request, Amazon SageMaker does the following: <ol> <li> Creates a network interface in the Amazon SageMaker VPC. </li> <li> (Option) If you specified <code>SubnetId</code>, Amazon SageMaker creates a network interface in your own VPC, which is inferred from the subnet ID that you provide in the input. When creating this network interface, Amazon SageMaker attaches the security group that you specified in the request to the network interface that it creates in your VPC. </li> <li> Launches an EC2 instance of the type specified in the request in the Amazon SageMaker VPC. If you specified <code>SubnetId</code> of your VPC, Amazon SageMaker specifies both network interfaces when launching this instance. This enables inbound traffic from your own VPC to the notebook instance, assuming that the security groups allow it. </li> </ol> After creating the notebook instance, Amazon SageMaker returns its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You can't change the name of a notebook instance after you create it. After Amazon SageMaker creates the notebook instance, you can connect to the Jupyter server and work in Jupyter notebooks. For example, you can write code to explore a dataset that you can use for model training, train a model, host models by creating Amazon SageMaker endpoints, and validate hosted models.

          Starts a model training job. After training completes, Amazon SageMaker saves the resulting model artifacts to an Amazon S3 location that you specify. If you choose to host your model using Amazon SageMaker hosting services, you can use the resulting model artifacts as part of the model. You can also use the artifacts in a machine learning service other than Amazon SageMaker, provided that you know how to use them for inference. In the request body, you provide the following: <ul> <li> <code>AlgorithmSpecification</code> - Identifies the training algorithm to use. </li> <li> <code>HyperParameters</code> - Specify these algorithm-specific parameters to enable the estimation of model parameters during training. Hyperparameters can be tuned to optimize this learning process. For a list of hyperparameters for each training algorithm provided by Amazon SageMaker, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/algos.html">Algorithms</a>. </li> <li> <code>InputDataConfig</code> - Describes the training dataset and the Amazon S3, EFS, or FSx location where it is stored. </li> <li> <code>OutputDataConfig</code> - Identifies the Amazon S3 bucket where you want Amazon SageMaker to save the results of model training. </li> <li> <code>ResourceConfig</code> - Identifies the resources, ML compute instances, and ML storage volumes to deploy for model training. In distributed training, you specify more than one instance. </li> <li> <code>EnableManagedSpotTraining</code> - Optimize the cost of training machine learning models by up to 80% by using Amazon EC2 Spot instances. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-managed-spot-training.html">Managed Spot Training</a>. </li> <li> <code>RoleArn</code> - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that Amazon SageMaker assumes to perform tasks on your behalf during model training. You must grant this role the necessary permissions so that Amazon SageMaker can successfully complete model training. </li> <li> <code>StoppingCondition</code> - To help cap training costs, use <code>MaxRuntimeInSeconds</code> to set a time limit for training. Use <code>MaxWaitTimeInSeconds</code> to specify how long a managed spot training job has to complete. </li> <li> <code>Environment</code> - The environment variables to set in the Docker container. </li> <li> <code>RetryStrategy</code> - The number of times to retry the job when the job fails due to an <code>InternalServerError</code>. </li> </ul> For more information about Amazon SageMaker, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works.html">How It Works</a>.

          Stops a pipeline execution. <b>Callback Step</b> A pipeline execution won't stop while a callback step is running. When you call <code>StopPipelineExecution</code> on a pipeline execution with a running callback step, SageMaker Pipelines sends an additional Amazon SQS message to the specified SQS queue. The body of the SQS message contains a "Status" field which is set to "Stopping". You should add logic to your Amazon SQS message consumer to take any needed action (for example, resource cleanup) upon receipt of the message followed by a call to <code>SendPipelineExecutionStepSuccess</code> or <code>SendPipelineExecutionStepFailure</code>. Only when SageMaker Pipelines receives one of these calls will it stop the pipeline execution. <b>Lambda Step</b> A pipeline execution can't be stopped while a lambda step is running because the Lambda function invoked by the lambda step can't be stopped. If you attempt to stop the execution while the Lambda function is running, the pipeline waits for the Lambda function to finish or until the timeout is hit, whichever occurs first, and then stops. If the Lambda function finishes, the pipeline execution status is <code>Stopped</code>. If the timeout is hit the pipeline execution status is <code>Failed</code>.

          Use this operation to update your workforce. You can use this operation to require that workers use specific IP addresses to work on tasks and to update your OpenID Connect (OIDC) Identity Provider (IdP) workforce configuration. Use <code>SourceIpConfig</code> to restrict worker access to tasks to a specific range of IP addresses. You specify allowed IP addresses by creating a list of up to ten <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html">CIDRs</a>. By default, a workforce isn't restricted to specific IP addresses. If you specify a range of IP addresses, workers who attempt to access tasks using any IP address outside the specified range are denied and get a <code>Not Found</code> error message on the worker portal. Use <code>OidcConfig</code> to update the configuration of a workforce created using your own OIDC IdP. <important> You can only update your OIDC IdP configuration when there are no work teams associated with your workforce. You can delete work teams using the operation. </important> After restricting access to a range of IP addresses or updating your OIDC IdP configuration with this operation, you can view details about your update workforce using the operation. <important> This operation only applies to private workforces. </important>

          Creates a new secret. A secret in Secrets Manager consists of both the protected secret data and the important information needed to manage the secret. Secrets Manager stores the encrypted secret data in one of a collection of "versions" associated with the secret. Each version contains a copy of the encrypted secret data. Each version is associated with one or more "staging labels" that identify where the version is in the rotation cycle. The <code>SecretVersionsToStages</code> field of the secret contains the mapping of staging labels to the active versions of the secret. Versions without a staging label are considered deprecated and not included in the list. You provide the secret data to be encrypted by putting text in either the <code>SecretString</code> parameter or binary data in the <code>SecretBinary</code> parameter, but not both. If you include <code>SecretString</code> or <code>SecretBinary</code> then Secrets Manager also creates an initial secret version and automatically attaches the staging label <code>AWSCURRENT</code> to the new version. <note> <ul> <li> If you call an operation to encrypt or decrypt the <code>SecretString</code> or <code>SecretBinary</code> for a secret in the same account as the calling user and that secret doesn't specify a Amazon Web Services KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the account's default Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) with the alias <code>aws/secretsmanager</code>. If this key doesn't already exist in your account then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the same Amazon Web Services account automatically have access to use the default CMK. Note that if an Secrets Manager API call results in Amazon Web Services creating the account's Amazon Web Services-managed CMK, it can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result. </li> <li> If the secret resides in a different Amazon Web Services account from the credentials calling an API that requires encryption or decryption of the secret value then you must create and use a custom Amazon Web Services KMS CMK because you can't access the default CMK for the account using credentials from a different Amazon Web Services account. Store the ARN of the CMK in the secret when you create the secret or when you update it by including it in the <code>KMSKeyId</code>. If you call an API that must encrypt or decrypt <code>SecretString</code> or <code>SecretBinary</code> using credentials from a different account then the Amazon Web Services KMS key policy must grant cross-account access to that other account's user or role for both the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt operations. </li> </ul> </note> <b>Minimum permissions</b> To run this command, you must have the following permissions: <ul> <li> secretsmanager:CreateSecret </li> <li> kms:GenerateDataKey - needed only if you use a customer-managed Amazon Web Services KMS key to encrypt the secret. You do not need this permission to use the account default Amazon Web Services managed CMK for Secrets Manager. </li> <li> kms:Decrypt - needed only if you use a customer-managed Amazon Web Services KMS key to encrypt the secret. You do not need this permission to use the account default Amazon Web Services managed CMK for Secrets Manager. </li> <li> secretsmanager:TagResource - needed only if you include the <code>Tags</code> parameter. </li> </ul> <b>Related operations</b> <ul> <li> To delete a secret, use <a>DeleteSecret</a>. </li> <li> To modify an existing secret, use <a>UpdateSecret</a>. </li> <li> To create a new version of a secret, use <a>PutSecretValue</a>. </li> <li> To retrieve the encrypted secure string and secure binary values, use <a>GetSecretValue</a>. </li> <li> To retrieve all other details for a secret, use <a>DescribeSecret</a>.

          Deletes an entire secret and all of the versions. You can optionally include a recovery window during which you can restore the secret. If you don't specify a recovery window value, the operation defaults to 30 days. Secrets Manager attaches a <code>DeletionDate</code> stamp to the secret that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Secrets Manager deletes the secret permanently. At any time before recovery window ends, you can use <a>RestoreSecret</a> to remove the <code>DeletionDate</code> and cancel the deletion of the secret. You cannot access the encrypted secret information in any secret scheduled for deletion. If you need to access that information, you must cancel the deletion with <a>RestoreSecret</a> and then retrieve the information. <note> <ul> <li> There is no explicit operation to delete a version of a secret. Instead, remove all staging labels from the <code>VersionStage</code> field of a version. That marks the version as deprecated and allows Secrets Manager to delete it as needed. Versions without any staging labels do not show up in <a>ListSecretVersionIds</a> unless you specify <code>IncludeDeprecated</code>. </li> <li> The permanent secret deletion at the end of the waiting period is performed as a background task with low priority. There is no guarantee of a specific time after the recovery window for the actual delete operation to occur. </li> </ul> </note> <b>Minimum permissions</b> To run this command, you must have the following permissions: <ul> <li> secretsmanager:DeleteSecret </li> </ul> <b>Related operations</b> <ul> <li> To create a secret, use <a>CreateSecret</a>. </li> <li> To cancel deletion of a version of a secret before the recovery window has expired, use <a>RestoreSecret</a>. </li> </ul>

          Attaches the contents of the specified resource-based permission policy to a secret. A resource-based policy is optional. Alternatively, you can use IAM identity-based policies that specify the secret's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in the policy statement's <code>Resources</code> element.

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Stores a new encrypted secret value in the specified secret. To do this, the operation creates a new version and attaches it to the secret. The version can contain a new <code>SecretString</code> value or a new <code>SecretBinary</code> value. You can also specify the staging labels that are initially attached to the new version. We recommend you avoid calling <code>PutSecretValue</code> at a sustained rate of more than once every 10 minutes. When you update the secret value, Secrets Manager creates a new version of the secret. Secrets Manager removes outdated versions when there are more than 100, but it does not remove versions created less than 24 hours ago. If you call <code>PutSecretValue</code> more than once every 10 minutes, you create more versions than Secrets Manager removes, and you will reach the quota for secret versions. <ul> <li> If this operation creates the first version for the secret then Secrets Manager automatically attaches the staging label <code>AWSCURRENT</code> to the new version. </li> <li> If you do not specify a value for VersionStages then Secrets Manager automatically moves the staging label <code>AWSCURRENT</code> to this new version. </li> <li> If this operation moves the staging label <code>AWSCURRENT</code> from another version to this version, then Secrets Manager also automatically moves the staging label <code>AWSPREVIOUS</code> to the version that <code>AWSCURRENT</code> was removed from. </li> <li> This operation is idempotent. If a version with a <code>VersionId</code> with the same value as the <code>ClientRequestToken</code> parameter already exists and you specify the same secret data, the operation succeeds but does nothing. However, if the secret data is different, then the operation fails because you cannot modify an existing version; you can only create new ones. </li> </ul> <note> <ul> <li> If you call an operation to encrypt or decrypt the <code>SecretString</code> or <code>SecretBinary</code> for a secret in the same account as the calling user and that secret doesn't specify a Amazon Web Services KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the account's default Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) with the alias <code>aws/secretsmanager</code>. If this key doesn't already exist in your account then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the same Amazon Web Services account automatically have access to use the default CMK. Note that if an Secrets Manager API call results in Amazon Web Services creating the account's Amazon Web Services-managed CMK, it can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result. </li> <li> If the secret resides in a different Amazon Web Services account from the credentials calling an API that requires encryption or decryption of the secret value then you must create and use a custom Amazon Web Services KMS CMK because you can't access the default CMK for the account using credentials from a different Amazon Web Services account. Store the ARN of the CMK in the secret when you create the secret or when you update it by including it in the <code>KMSKeyId</code>. If you call an API that must encrypt or decrypt <code>SecretString</code> or <code>SecretBinary</code> using credentials from a different account then the Amazon Web Services KMS key policy must grant cross-account access to that other account's user or role for both the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt operations. </li> </ul> </note> <b>Minimum permissions</b> To run this command, you must have the following permissions: <ul> <li> secretsmanager:PutSecretValue </li> <li> kms:GenerateDataKey - needed only if you use a customer-managed Amazon Web Services KMS key to encrypt the secret.

          Configures and starts the asynchronous process of rotating this secret. If you include the configuration parameters, the operation sets those values for the secret and then immediately starts a rotation. If you do not include the configuration parameters, the operation starts a rotation with the values already stored in the secret. After the rotation completes, the protected service and its clients all use the new version of the secret. This required configuration information includes the ARN of an Amazon Web Services Lambda function and optionally, the time between scheduled rotations. The Lambda rotation function creates a new version of the secret and creates or updates the credentials on the protected service to match. After testing the new credentials, the function marks the new secret with the staging label <code>AWSCURRENT</code> so that your clients all immediately begin to use the new version. For more information about rotating secrets and how to configure a Lambda function to rotate the secrets for your protected service, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotating-secrets.html">Rotating Secrets in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide</i>. Secrets Manager schedules the next rotation when the previous one completes. Secrets Manager schedules the date by adding the rotation interval (number of days) to the actual date of the last rotation. The service chooses the hour within that 24-hour date window randomly. The minute is also chosen somewhat randomly, but weighted towards the top of the hour and influenced by a variety of factors that help distribute load. The rotation function must end with the versions of the secret in one of two states: <ul> <li> The <code>AWSPENDING</code> and <code>AWSCURRENT</code> staging labels are attached to the same version of the secret, or </li> <li> The <code>AWSPENDING</code> staging label is not attached to any version of the secret. </li> </ul> If the <code>AWSPENDING</code> staging label is present but not attached to the same version as <code>AWSCURRENT</code> then any later invocation of <code>RotateSecret</code> assumes that a previous rotation request is still in progress and returns an error. <b>Minimum permissions</b> To run this command, you must have the following permissions: <ul> <li> secretsmanager:RotateSecret </li> <li> lambda:InvokeFunction (on the function specified in the secret's metadata) </li> </ul> <b>Related operations</b> <ul> <li> To list the secrets in your account, use <a>ListSecrets</a>. </li> <li> To get the details for a version of a secret, use <a>DescribeSecret</a>. </li> <li> To create a new version of a secret, use <a>CreateSecret</a>. </li> <li> To attach staging labels to or remove staging labels from a version of a secret, use <a>UpdateSecretVersionStage</a>. </li> </ul>

If you are integrated with Organizations, then the administrator account is designated by the organization management account. <code>CreateMembers</code> is always used to add accounts that are not organization members. For accounts that are managed using Organizations, <code>CreateMembers</code> is only used in the following cases: <ul> <li> Security Hub is not configured to automatically add new organization accounts. </li> <li> The account was disassociated or deleted in Security Hub. </li> </ul> This action can only be used by an account that has Security Hub enabled. To enable Security Hub, you can use the <code>EnableSecurityHub</code> operation. For accounts that are not organization members, you create the account association and then send an invitation to the member account. To send the invitation, you use the <code>InviteMembers</code> operation. If the account owner accepts the invitation, the account becomes a member account in Security Hub. Accounts that are managed using Organizations do not receive an invitation. They automatically become a member account in Security Hub. <ul> <li> If the organization account does not have Security Hub enabled, then Security Hub and the default standards are automatically enabled. Note that Security Hub cannot be enabled automatically for the organization management account. The organization management account must enable Security Hub before the administrator account enables it as a member account. </li> <li> For organization accounts that already have Security Hub enabled, Security Hub does not make any other changes to those accounts. It does not change their enabled standards or controls. </li> </ul> A permissions policy is added that permits the administrator account to view the findings generated in the member account. To remove the association between the administrator and member accounts, use the <code>DisassociateFromMasterAccount</code> or <code>DisassociateMembers</code> operation.

Once imported, all supported Service Catalog governance actions are supported on the provisioned product. Resource import only supports CloudFormation stack ARNs. CloudFormation StackSets and non-root nested stacks are not supported. The CloudFormation stack must have one of the following statuses to be imported: <code>CREATE_COMPLETE</code>, <code>UPDATE_COMPLETE</code>, <code>UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE</code>, <code>IMPORT_COMPLETE</code>, <code>IMPORT_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE</code>. Import of the resource requires that the CloudFormation stack template matches the associated Service Catalog product provisioning artifact. The user or role that performs this operation must have the <code>cloudformation:GetTemplate</code> and <code>cloudformation:DescribeStacks</code> IAM policy permissions.

The verification status of an email address is "Pending" until the email address owner clicks the link within the verification email that Amazon SES sent to that address. If the email address owner clicks the link within 24 hours, the verification status of the email address changes to "Success". If the link is not clicked within 24 hours, the verification status changes to "Failed." In that case, if you still want to verify the email address, you must restart the verification process from the beginning. For domain identities, the domain's verification status is "Pending" as Amazon SES searches for the required TXT record in the DNS settings of the domain. When Amazon SES detects the record, the domain's verification status changes to "Success". If Amazon SES is unable to detect the record within 72 hours, the domain's verification status changes to "Failed." In that case, if you still want to verify the domain, you must restart the verification process from the beginning. This operation is throttled at one request per second and can only get verification attributes for up to 100 identities at a time.

          Composes an email message and immediately queues it for sending. This operation is more flexible than the <code>SendEmail</code> API operation. When you use the <code>SendRawEmail</code> operation, you can specify the headers of the message as well as its content. This flexibility is useful, for example, when you want to send a multipart MIME email (such a message that contains both a text and an HTML version). You can also use this operation to send messages that include attachments. The <code>SendRawEmail</code> operation has the following requirements: <ul> <li> You can only send email from <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-addresses-and-domains.html">verified email addresses or domains</a>. If you try to send email from an address that isn't verified, the operation results in an "Email address not verified" error. </li> <li> If your account is still in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/request-production-access.html">Amazon SES sandbox</a>, you can only send email to other verified addresses in your account, or to addresses that are associated with the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/mailbox-simulator.html">Amazon SES mailbox simulator</a>. </li> <li> The maximum message size, including attachments, is 10 MB. </li> <li> Each message has to include at least one recipient address. A recipient address includes any address on the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines. </li> <li> If you send a single message to more than one recipient address, and one of the recipient addresses isn't in a valid format (that is, it's not in the format <i>UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain</i>), Amazon SES rejects the entire message, even if the other addresses are valid. </li> <li> Each message can include up to 50 recipient addresses across the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines. If you need to send a single message to more than 50 recipients, you have to split the list of recipient addresses into groups of less than 50 recipients, and send separate messages to each group. </li> <li> Amazon SES allows you to specify 8-bit Content-Transfer-Encoding for MIME message parts. However, if Amazon SES has to modify the contents of your message (for example, if you use open and click tracking), 8-bit content isn't preserved. For this reason, we highly recommend that you encode all content that isn't 7-bit ASCII. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-email-raw.html#send-email-mime-encoding">MIME Encoding</a> in the <i>Amazon SES Developer Guide</i>. </li> </ul> Additionally, keep the following considerations in mind when using the <code>SendRawEmail</code> operation: <ul> <li> Although you can customize the message headers when using the <code>SendRawEmail</code> operation, Amazon SES will automatically apply its own <code>Message-ID</code> and <code>Date</code> headers; if you passed these headers when creating the message, they will be overwritten by the values that Amazon SES provides. </li> <li> If you are using sending authorization to send on behalf of another user, <code>SendRawEmail</code> enables you to specify the cross-account identity for the email's Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one of two ways: you can pass optional parameters <code>SourceArn</code>, <code>FromArn</code>, and/or <code>ReturnPathArn</code> to the API, or you can include the following X-headers in the header of your raw email: <ul> <li> <code>X-SES-SOURCE-ARN</code> </li> <li> <code>X-SES-FROM-ARN</code> </li> <li> <code>X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN</code> </li> </ul> <important> Don't include these X-headers in the DKIM signature. Amazon SES removes these before it sends the email. </important> If you only specify the <code>SourceIdentityArn</code> parameter, Amazon SES sets the From and Return-Path addresses to the same identity that you specified. For more information about sending authorization, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html">Using Sending Authorization with Amazon SES</a> in the <i>Amazon SES Developer Guide.</i> </li> <li> For every message that you send, the total number of recipients (including each recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted against the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period (your <i>sending quota</i>).

          Returns a set of DKIM tokens for a domain identity. <important> When you execute the <code>VerifyDomainDkim</code> operation, the domain that you specify is added to the list of identities that are associated with your account. This is true even if you haven't already associated the domain with your account by using the <code>VerifyDomainIdentity</code> operation. However, you can't send email from the domain until you either successfully <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-domains.html">verify it</a> or you successfully <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/easy-dkim.html">set up DKIM for it</a>. </important> You use the tokens that are generated by this operation to create CNAME records. When Amazon SES detects that you've added these records to the DNS configuration for a domain, you can start sending email from that domain. You can start sending email even if you haven't added the TXT record provided by the VerifyDomainIdentity operation to the DNS configuration for your domain. All email that you send from the domain is authenticated using DKIM. To create the CNAME records for DKIM authentication, use the following values: <ul> <li> <b>Name</b>: <i>token</i>._domainkey.<i>example.com</i> </li> <li> <b>Type</b>: CNAME </li> <li> <b>Value</b>: <i>token</i>.dkim.amazonses.com </li> </ul> In the preceding example, replace <i>token</i> with one of the tokens that are generated when you execute this operation. Replace <i>example.com</i> with your domain. Repeat this process for each token that's generated by this operation. You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

          Create a new predictive inbox placement test. Predictive inbox placement tests can help you predict how your messages will be handled by various email providers around the world. When you perform a predictive inbox placement test, you provide a sample message that contains the content that you plan to send to your customers. Amazon SES then sends that message to special email addresses spread across several major email providers. After about 24 hours, the test is complete, and you can use the <code>GetDeliverabilityTestReport</code> operation to view the results of the test.

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Starts the process of verifying an email identity. An <i>identity</i> is an email address or domain that you use when you send email. Before you can use an identity to send email, you first have to verify it. By verifying an identity, you demonstrate that you're the owner of the identity, and that you've given Amazon SES API v2 permission to send email from the identity. When you verify an email address, Amazon SES sends an email to the address. Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link in the verification email. When you verify a domain without specifying the <code>DkimSigningAttributes</code> object, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens. You can convert these tokens into CNAME records, which you then add to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. This verification method is known as <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/easy-dkim.html">Easy DKIM</a>. Alternatively, you can perform the verification process by providing your own public-private key pair. This verification method is known as Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM). To use BYODKIM, your call to the <code>CreateEmailIdentity</code> operation has to include the <code>DkimSigningAttributes</code> object. When you specify this object, you provide a selector (a component of the DNS record name that identifies the public key to use for DKIM authentication) and a private key. When you verify a domain, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens, which you can convert into CNAME tokens. You add these CNAME tokens to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. For some DNS providers, it can take 72 hours or more to complete the domain verification process. Additionally, you can associate an existing configuration set with the email identity that you're verifying.

          Returns a link to an Amazon S3 presigned URL for the manifest file associated with the specified <code>JobId</code> value. You can access the manifest file for up to 60 minutes after this request has been made. To access the manifest file after 60 minutes have passed, you'll have to make another call to the <code>GetJobManifest</code> action. The manifest is an encrypted file that you can download after your job enters the <code>WithCustomer</code> status. The manifest is decrypted by using the <code>UnlockCode</code> code value, when you pass both values to the Snow device through the Snowball client when the client is started for the first time. As a best practice, we recommend that you don't save a copy of an <code>UnlockCode</code> value in the same location as the manifest file for that job. Saving these separately helps prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the Snow device associated with that job. The credentials of a given job, including its manifest file and unlock code, expire 360 days after the job is created.

A particular <code>UnlockCode</code> value can be accessed for up to 360 days after the associated job has been created. The <code>UnlockCode</code> value is a 29-character code with 25 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens. This code is used to decrypt the manifest file when it is passed along with the manifest to the Snow device through the Snowball client when the client is started for the first time. As a best practice, we recommend that you don't save a copy of the <code>UnlockCode</code> in the same location as the manifest file for that job.

The <code>CreatePlatformEndpoint</code> action is idempotent, so if the requester already owns an endpoint with the same device token and attributes, that endpoint's ARN is returned without creating a new endpoint. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SNSMobilePush.html">Using Amazon SNS Mobile Push Notifications</a>. When using <code>CreatePlatformEndpoint</code> with Baidu, two attributes must be provided: ChannelId and UserId. The token field must also contain the ChannelId.

          Sends a message to an Amazon SNS topic, a text message (SMS message) directly to a phone number, or a message to a mobile platform endpoint (when you specify the <code>TargetArn</code>). If you send a message to a topic, Amazon SNS delivers the message to each endpoint that is subscribed to the topic. The format of the message depends on the notification protocol for each subscribed endpoint. When a <code>messageId</code> is returned, the message has been saved and Amazon SNS will attempt to deliver it shortly. To use the <code>Publish</code> action for sending a message to a mobile endpoint, such as an app on a Kindle device or mobile phone, you must specify the EndpointArn for the TargetArn parameter. The EndpointArn is returned when making a call with the <code>CreatePlatformEndpoint</code> action. For more information about formatting messages, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/mobile-push-send-custommessage.html">Send Custom Platform-Specific Payloads in Messages to Mobile Devices</a>. <important> You can publish messages only to topics and endpoints in the same Region. </important>

This is a batch version of <code> <a>DeleteMessage</a>.</code> The result of the action on each message is reported individually in the response. <important> Because the batch request can result in a combination of successful and unsuccessful actions, you should check for batch errors even when the call returns an HTTP status code of <code>200</code>. </important> Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the <code>param.n</code> notation. Values of <code>n</code> are integers starting from 1.

          Retrieves one or more messages (up to 10), from the specified queue. Using the <code>WaitTimeSeconds</code> parameter enables long-poll support. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-long-polling.html">Amazon SQS Long Polling</a> in the <i>Amazon SQS Developer Guide</i>. Short poll is the default behavior where a weighted random set of machines is sampled on a <code>ReceiveMessage</code> call. Thus, only the messages on the sampled machines are returned. If the number of messages in the queue is small (fewer than 1,000), you most likely get fewer messages than you requested per <code>ReceiveMessage</code> call. If the number of messages in the queue is extremely small, you might not receive any messages in a particular <code>ReceiveMessage</code> response. If this happens, repeat the request. For each message returned, the response includes the following: <ul> <li> The message body. </li> <li> An MD5 digest of the message body. For information about MD5, see <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt">RFC1321</a>. </li> <li> The <code>MessageId</code> you received when you sent the message to the queue. </li> <li> The receipt handle. </li> <li> The message attributes. </li> <li> An MD5 digest of the message attributes. </li> </ul> The receipt handle is the identifier you must provide when deleting the message. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-queue-message-identifiers.html">Queue and Message Identifiers</a> in the <i>Amazon SQS Developer Guide</i>. You can provide the <code>VisibilityTimeout</code> parameter in your request. The parameter is applied to the messages that Amazon SQS returns in the response. If you don't include the parameter, the overall visibility timeout for the queue is used for the returned messages. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html">Visibility Timeout</a> in the <i>Amazon SQS Developer Guide</i>. A message that isn't deleted or a message whose visibility isn't extended before the visibility timeout expires counts as a failed receive. Depending on the configuration of the queue, the message might be sent to the dead-letter queue. <note> In the future, new attributes might be added. If you write code that calls this action, we recommend that you structure your code so that it can handle new attributes gracefully. </note>

        <details>
          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource. Tags are metadata that you can assign to your documents, managed instances, maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account's managed instances that helps you track each instance's owner and stack level. For example: <ul> <li> <code>Key=Owner,Value=DbAdmin</code> </li> <li> <code>Key=Owner,Value=SysAdmin</code> </li> <li> <code>Key=Owner,Value=Dev</code> </li> <li> <code>Key=Stack,Value=Production</code> </li> <li> <code>Key=Stack,Value=Pre-Production</code> </li> <li> <code>Key=Stack,Value=Test</code> </li> </ul> Each resource can have a maximum of 50 tags. We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each resource type. Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources. You can search and filter the resources based on the tags you add. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to and are interpreted strictly as a string of characters. For more information about using tags with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html">Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.

          Generates an activation code and activation ID you can use to register your on-premises server or virtual machine (VM) with Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. Registering these machines with Systems Manager makes it possible to manage them using Systems Manager capabilities. You use the activation code and ID when installing SSM Agent on machines in your hybrid environment. For more information about requirements for managing on-premises instances and VMs using Systems Manager, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-managedinstances.html">Setting up Amazon Web Services Systems Manager for hybrid environments</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide</i>. <note> On-premises servers or VMs that are registered with Systems Manager and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that you manage with Systems Manager are all called <i>managed instances</i>. </note>

          A State Manager association defines the state that you want to maintain on your instances. For example, an association can specify that anti-virus software must be installed and running on your instances, or that certain ports must be closed. For static targets, the association specifies a schedule for when the configuration is reapplied. For dynamic targets, such as an Amazon Web Services resource group or an Amazon Web Services autoscaling group, State Manager, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager applies the configuration when new instances are added to the group. The association also specifies actions to take when applying the configuration. For example, an association for anti-virus software might run once a day. If the software isn't installed, then State Manager installs it. If the software is installed, but the service isn't running, then the association might instruct State Manager to start the service.

          A resource data sync helps you view data from multiple sources in a single location. Amazon Web Services Systems Manager offers two types of resource data sync: <code>SyncToDestination</code> and <code>SyncFromSource</code>. You can configure Systems Manager Inventory to use the <code>SyncToDestination</code> type to synchronize Inventory data from multiple Amazon Web Services Regions to a single Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-inventory-datasync.html">Configuring resource data sync for Inventory</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide</i>. You can configure Systems Manager Explorer to use the <code>SyncFromSource</code> type to synchronize operational work items (OpsItems) and operational data (OpsData) from multiple Amazon Web Services Regions to a single Amazon S3 bucket. This type can synchronize OpsItems and OpsData from multiple Amazon Web Services accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions or <code>EntireOrganization</code> by using Organizations. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/Explorer-resource-data-sync.html">Setting up Systems Manager Explorer to display data from multiple accounts and Regions</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide</i>. A resource data sync is an asynchronous operation that returns immediately. After a successful initial sync is completed, the system continuously syncs data. To check the status of a sync, use the <a>ListResourceDataSync</a>. <note> By default, data isn't encrypted in Amazon S3. We strongly recommend that you enable encryption in Amazon S3 to ensure secure data storage. We also recommend that you secure access to the Amazon S3 bucket by creating a restrictive bucket policy. </note>

          <code>ServiceSetting</code> is an account-level setting for an Amazon Web Services service. This setting defines how a user interacts with or uses a service or a feature of a service. For example, if an Amazon Web Services service charges money to the account based on feature or service usage, then the Amazon Web Services service team might create a default setting of <code>false</code>. This means the user can't use this feature unless they change the setting to <code>true</code> and intentionally opt in for a paid feature. Services map a <code>SettingId</code> object to a setting value. Amazon Web Services services teams define the default value for a <code>SettingId</code>. You can't create a new <code>SettingId</code>, but you can overwrite the default value if you have the <code>ssm:UpdateServiceSetting</code> permission for the setting. Use the <a>UpdateServiceSetting</a> API operation to change the default setting. Or use the <a>ResetServiceSetting</a> to change the value back to the original value defined by the Amazon Web Services service team. Query the current service setting for the Amazon Web Services account.

          A parameter label is a user-defined alias to help you manage different versions of a parameter. When you modify a parameter, Amazon Web Services Systems Manager automatically saves a new version and increments the version number by one. A label can help you remember the purpose of a parameter when there are multiple versions. Parameter labels have the following requirements and restrictions. <ul> <li> A version of a parameter can have a maximum of 10 labels. </li> <li> You can't attach the same label to different versions of the same parameter. For example, if version 1 has the label Production, then you can't attach Production to version 2. </li> <li> You can move a label from one version of a parameter to another. </li> <li> You can't create a label when you create a new parameter. You must attach a label to a specific version of a parameter. </li> <li> If you no longer want to use a parameter label, then you can either delete it or move it to a different version of a parameter. </li> <li> A label can have a maximum of 100 characters. </li> <li> Labels can contain letters (case sensitive), numbers, periods (.), hyphens (-), or underscores (_). </li> <li> Labels can't begin with a number, "<code>aws</code>" or "<code>ssm</code>" (not case sensitive). If a label fails to meet these requirements, then the label isn't associated with a parameter and the system displays it in the list of InvalidLabels. </li> </ul>

          <code>ServiceSetting</code> is an account-level setting for an Amazon Web Services service. This setting defines how a user interacts with or uses a service or a feature of a service. For example, if an Amazon Web Services service charges money to the account based on feature or service usage, then the Amazon Web Services service team might create a default setting of "false". This means the user can't use this feature unless they change the setting to "true" and intentionally opt in for a paid feature. Services map a <code>SettingId</code> object to a setting value. Amazon Web Services services teams define the default value for a <code>SettingId</code>. You can't create a new <code>SettingId</code>, but you can overwrite the default value if you have the <code>ssm:UpdateServiceSetting</code> permission for the setting. Use the <a>GetServiceSetting</a> API operation to view the current value. Use the <a>UpdateServiceSetting</a> API operation to change the default setting. Reset the service setting for the account to the default value as provisioned by the Amazon Web Services service team.

          Creates an activity. An activity is a task that you write in any programming language and host on any machine that has access to AWS Step Functions. Activities must poll Step Functions using the <code>GetActivityTask</code> API action and respond using <code>SendTask*</code> API actions. This function lets Step Functions know the existence of your activity and returns an identifier for use in a state machine and when polling from the activity. <note> This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes. </note> <note> <code>CreateActivity</code> is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests wonâ€™t create a duplicate resource if it was already created. <code>CreateActivity</code>'s idempotency check is based on the activity <code>name</code>. If a following request has different <code>tags</code> values, Step Functions will ignore these differences and treat it as an idempotent request of the previous. In this case, <code>tags</code> will not be updated, even if they are different. </note>

          Creates a state machine. A state machine consists of a collection of states that can do work (<code>Task</code> states), determine to which states to transition next (<code>Choice</code> states), stop an execution with an error (<code>Fail</code> states), and so on. State machines are specified using a JSON-based, structured language. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-amazon-states-language.html">Amazon States Language</a> in the AWS Step Functions User Guide. <note> This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes. </note> <note> <code>CreateStateMachine</code> is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests wonâ€™t create a duplicate resource if it was already created. <code>CreateStateMachine</code>'s idempotency check is based on the state machine <code>name</code>, <code>definition</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>LoggingConfiguration</code> and <code>TracingConfiguration</code>. If a following request has a different <code>roleArn</code> or <code>tags</code>, Step Functions will ignore these differences and treat it as an idempotent request of the previous. In this case, <code>roleArn</code> and <code>tags</code> will not be updated, even if they are different. </note>

          Used by workers to retrieve a task (with the specified activity ARN) which has been scheduled for execution by a running state machine. This initiates a long poll, where the service holds the HTTP connection open and responds as soon as a task becomes available (i.e. an execution of a task of this type is needed.) The maximum time the service holds on to the request before responding is 60 seconds. If no task is available within 60 seconds, the poll returns a <code>taskToken</code> with a null string. <important> Workers should set their client side socket timeout to at least 65 seconds (5 seconds higher than the maximum time the service may hold the poll request). Polling with <code>GetActivityTask</code> can cause latency in some implementations. See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/bp-activity-pollers.html">Avoid Latency When Polling for Activity Tasks</a> in the Step Functions Developer Guide. </important>

          Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to access Amazon Web Services resources that you might not normally have access to. These temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use <code>AssumeRole</code> within your account or for cross-account access. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRole</code> with other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing the STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. <b>Permissions</b> The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> can be used to make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the following exception: You cannot call the STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API operations. (Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policies</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. To assume a role from a different account, your account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account. A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that are delegated from the user account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> for the ARN of the role in the other account. If the user is in the same account as the role, then you can do either of the following: <ul> <li> Attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous user in a different account). </li> <li> Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy. </li> </ul> In this case, the trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy. Users in the same account as the role do not need explicit permission to assume the role. For more information about trust policies and resource-based policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html">IAM Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. <b>Tags</b> (Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These tags are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html">Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist during role chaining. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining">Chaining Roles with Session Tags</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. <b>Using MFA with AssumeRole</b> (Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when you call <code>AssumeRole</code>. This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an Amazon Web Services MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example. <code>"Condition": {"Bool": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true}}</code> For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html">Configuring MFA-Protected API Access</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i> guide. To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The <code>SerialNumber</code> value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The <code>TokenCode</code> is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces.

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been authenticated via a SAML authentication response. This operation provides a mechanism for tying an enterprise identity store or directory to role-based Amazon Web Services access without user-specific credentials or configuration. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing the STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. The temporary security credentials returned by this operation consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to Amazon Web Services services. <b>Session Duration</b> By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. Your role session lasts for the duration that you specify, or until the time specified in the SAML authentication response's <code>SessionNotOnOrAfter</code> value, whichever is shorter. You can provide a <code>DurationSeconds</code> value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session">View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use the <code>AssumeRole*</code> API operations or the <code>assume-role*</code> CLI commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html">Using IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. <note> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-role-chaining">Role chaining</a> limits your CLI or Amazon Web Services API role session to a maximum of one hour. When you use the <code>AssumeRole</code> API operation to assume a role, you can specify the duration of your role session with the <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter. You can specify a parameter value of up to 43200 seconds (12 hours), depending on the maximum session duration setting for your role. However, if you assume a role using role chaining and provide a <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter value greater than one hour, the operation fails. </note> <b>Permissions</b> The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> can be used to make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the following exception: you cannot call the STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API operations.

Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> does not require the use of Amazon Web Services security credentials. The identity of the caller is validated by using keys in the metadata document that is uploaded for the SAML provider entity for your identity provider. <important> Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithSAML</code> can result in an entry in your CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the value in the <code>NameID</code> element of the SAML assertion. We recommend that you use a <code>NameIDType</code> that is not associated with any personally identifiable information (PII). For example, you could instead use the persistent identifier (<code>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent</code>). </important> <b>Tags</b> (Optional) You can configure your IdP to pass attributes into your SAML assertion as session tags. Each session tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about session tags, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plaintext session tag keys canâ€™t exceed 128 characters and the values canâ€™t exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-limits.html#reference_iam-limits-entity-length">IAM and STS Character Limits</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. <note> An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed session policies and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the other requirements. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit. </note> You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is attached to the role. When you do, session tags override the role's tags with the same key. An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html">Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.

Additionally, you must use Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create a SAML provider entity in your Amazon Web Services account that represents your identity provider. You must also create an IAM role that specifies this SAML provider in its trust policy.

          Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been authenticated in a mobile or web application with a web identity provider. Example providers include Amazon Cognito, Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. <note> For mobile applications, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito. You can use Amazon Cognito with the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforios/">Amazon Web Services SDK for iOS Developer Guide</a> and the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid/">Amazon Web Services SDK for Android Developer Guide</a> to uniquely identify a user.

To learn more about Amazon Cognito, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e840">Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in <i>Amazon Web Services SDK for Android Developer Guide</i> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e664">Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services SDK for iOS Developer Guide</i>. </note> Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> does not require the use of Amazon Web Services security credentials. Therefore, you can distribute an application (for example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials without including long-term Amazon Web Services credentials in the application. You also don't need to deploy server-based proxy services that use long-term Amazon Web Services credentials.

The role that your application assumes must trust the identity provider that is associated with the identity token. In other words, the identity provider must be specified in the role's trust policy. <important> Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can result in an entry in your CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims">Subject</a> of the provided web identity token. We recommend that you avoid using any personally identifiable information (PII) in this field. For example, you could instead use a GUID or a pairwise identifier, as <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SubjectIDTypes">suggested in the OIDC specification</a>. </important> For more information about how to use web identity federation and the <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> API, see the following resources: <ul> <li> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_oidc_manual.html">Using Web Identity Federation API Operations for Mobile Apps</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity">Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider</a>. </li> <li> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/the-aws-web-identity-federation-playground/"> Web Identity Federation Playground</a>.

          Decodes additional information about the authorization status of a request from an encoded message returned in response to an Amazon Web Services request. For example, if a user is not authorized to perform an operation that he or she has requested, the request returns a <code>Client.UnauthorizedOperation</code> response (an HTTP 403 response).

The documentation for an individual operation indicates whether that operation returns an encoded message in addition to returning an HTTP code. </note> The message is encoded because the details of the authorization status can constitute privileged information that the user who requested the operation should not see. To decode an authorization status message, a user must be granted permissions via an IAM policy to request the <code>DecodeAuthorizationMessage</code> (<code>sts:DecodeAuthorizationMessage</code>) action.

When you pass an access key ID to this operation, it returns the ID of the Amazon Web Services account to which the keys belong. Access key IDs beginning with <code>AKIA</code> are long-term credentials for an IAM user or the Amazon Web Services account root user. Access key IDs beginning with <code>ASIA</code> are temporary credentials that are created using STS operations. If the account in the response belongs to you, you can sign in as the root user and review your root user access keys. Then, you can pull a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_getting-report.html">credentials report</a> to learn which IAM user owns the keys.

          Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) for a federated user. A typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary security credentials on behalf of distributed applications inside a corporate network. You must call the <code>GetFederationToken</code> operation using the long-term security credentials of an IAM user.

Instead, we recommend that you create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy application. Then attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated users to only the actions and resources that they need to access. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html">IAM Best Practices</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. <b>Session duration</b> The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours). The default session duration is 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary credentials that are obtained by using Amazon Web Services account root user credentials have a maximum duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour). <b>Permissions</b> You can use the temporary credentials created by <code>GetFederationToken</code> in any Amazon Web Services service except the following: <ul> <li> You cannot call any IAM operations using the CLI or the Amazon Web Services API. </li> <li> You cannot call any STS operations except <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>. </li> </ul> You must pass an inline or managed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session">session policy</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a policy, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions. When you pass session policies, the session permissions are the intersection of the IAM user policies and the session policies that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the IAM user.

You can use the credentials to access a resource that has a resource-based policy. If that policy specifically references the federated user session in the <code>Principal</code> element of the policy, the session has the permissions allowed by the policy. These permissions are granted in addition to the permissions granted by the session policies. <b>Tags</b> (Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These are called session tags.

Tag keyâ€“value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This means that you cannot have separate <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> tag keys. Assume that the user that you are federating has the <code>Department</code>=<code>Marketing</code> tag and you pass the <code>department</code>=<code>engineering</code> session tag. <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over the user tag.

The worker can also specify details of the progress, for example percent complete, using the <code>details</code> parameter. This action can also be used by the worker as a mechanism to check if cancellation is being requested for the activity task.

          Creates a canary. Canaries are scripts that monitor your endpoints and APIs from the outside-in. Canaries help you check the availability and latency of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigating load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics. You can set up a canary to run continuously or just once. Do not use <code>CreateCanary</code> to modify an existing canary. Use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateCanary.html">UpdateCanary</a> instead. To create canaries, you must have the <code>CloudWatchSyntheticsFullAccess</code> policy. If you are creating a new IAM role for the canary, you also need the the <code>iam:CreateRole</code>, <code>iam:CreatePolicy</code> and <code>iam:AttachRolePolicy</code> permissions. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Roles">Necessary Roles and Permissions</a>. Do not include secrets or proprietary information in your canary names. The canary name makes up part of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the canary, and the ARN is included in outbound calls over the internet.

          Permanently deletes the specified canary. When you delete a canary, resources used and created by the canary are not automatically deleted. After you delete a canary that you do not intend to use again, you should also delete the following: <ul> <li> The Lambda functions and layers used by this canary. These have the prefix <code>cwsyn-<i>MyCanaryName</i> </code>. </li> <li> The CloudWatch alarms created for this canary. These alarms have a name of <code>Synthetics-SharpDrop-Alarm-<i>MyCanaryName</i> </code>. </li> <li> Amazon S3 objects and buckets, such as the canary's artifact location. </li> <li> IAM roles created for the canary. If they were created in the console, these roles have the name <code> role/service-role/CloudWatchSyntheticsRole-<i>MyCanaryName</i> </code>. </li> <li> CloudWatch Logs log groups created for the canary. These logs groups have the name <code>/aws/lambda/cwsyn-<i>MyCanaryName</i> </code>. </li> </ul> Before you delete a canary, you might want to use <code>GetCanary</code> to display the information about this canary. Make note of the information returned by this operation so that you can delete these resources after you delete the canary.

You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters. You can use the <code>TagResource</code> action with a canary that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the alarm, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the alarm. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the alarm, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag. You can associate as many as 50 tags with a canary.

          Modifies the retention duration of the memory store and magnetic store for your Timestream table. Note that the change in retention duration takes effect immediately. For example, if the retention period of the memory store was initially set to 2 hours and then changed to 24 hours, the memory store will be capable of holding 24 hours of data, but will be populated with 24 hours of data 22 hours after this change was made. Timestream does not retrieve data from the magnetic store to populate the memory store. Service quotas apply. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/ts-limits.html">Access Management</a> in the Timestream Developer Guide.

          Creates or updates a custom terminology, depending on whether or not one already exists for the given terminology name. Importing a terminology with the same name as an existing one will merge the terminologies based on the chosen merge strategy. Currently, the only supported merge strategy is OVERWRITE, and so the imported terminology will overwrite an existing terminology of the same name. If you import a terminology that overwrites an existing one, the new terminology take up to 10 minutes to fully propagate and be available for use in a translation due to cache policies with the DataPlane service that performs the translations.

          <note> This is <b>AWS WAF Classic</b> documentation. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/classic-waf-chapter.html">AWS WAF Classic</a> in the developer guide. <b>For the latest version of AWS WAF</b>, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html">AWS WAF Developer Guide</a>. With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use. </note> Creates a <a>RateBasedRule</a>. The <code>RateBasedRule</code> contains a <code>RateLimit</code>, which specifies the maximum number of requests that AWS WAF allows from a specified IP address in a five-minute period. The <code>RateBasedRule</code> also contains the <code>IPSet</code> objects, <code>ByteMatchSet</code> objects, and other predicates that identify the requests that you want to count or block if these requests exceed the <code>RateLimit</code>. If you add more than one predicate to a <code>RateBasedRule</code>, a request not only must exceed the <code>RateLimit</code>, but it also must match all the conditions to be counted or blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a <code>RateBasedRule</code>: <ul> <li> An <code>IPSet</code> that matches the IP address <code>192.0.2.44/32</code> </li> <li> A <code>ByteMatchSet</code> that matches <code>BadBot</code> in the <code>User-Agent</code> header </li> </ul> Further, you specify a <code>RateLimit</code> of 1,000. You then add the <code>RateBasedRule</code> to a <code>WebACL</code> and specify that you want to block requests that meet the conditions in the rule. For a request to be blocked, it must come from the IP address 192.0.2.44 <i>and</i> the <code>User-Agent</code> header in the request must contain the value <code>BadBot</code>. Further, requests that match these two conditions must be received at a rate of more than 1,000 requests every five minutes. If both conditions are met and the rate is exceeded, AWS WAF blocks the requests. If the rate drops below 1,000 for a five-minute period, AWS WAF no longer blocks the requests. As a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular page on your site. To do this, you could add the following to a <code>RateBasedRule</code>: <ul> <li> A <code>ByteMatchSet</code> with <code>FieldToMatch</code> of <code>URI</code> </li> <li> A <code>PositionalConstraint</code> of <code>STARTS_WITH</code> </li> <li> A <code>TargetString</code> of <code>login</code> </li> </ul> Further, you specify a <code>RateLimit</code> of 1,000. By adding this <code>RateBasedRule</code> to a <code>WebACL</code>, you could limit requests to your login page without affecting the rest of your site. To create and configure a <code>RateBasedRule</code>, perform the following steps: <ol> <li> Create and update the predicates that you want to include in the rule. For more information, see <a>CreateByteMatchSet</a>, <a>CreateIPSet</a>, and <a>CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet</a>. </li> <li> Use <a>GetChangeToken</a> to get the change token that you provide in the <code>ChangeToken</code> parameter of a <code>CreateRule</code> request. </li> <li> Submit a <code>CreateRateBasedRule</code> request. </li> <li> Use <code>GetChangeToken</code> to get the change token that you provide in the <code>ChangeToken</code> parameter of an <a>UpdateRule</a> request. </li> <li> Submit an <code>UpdateRateBasedRule</code> request to specify the predicates that you want to include in the rule. </li> <li> Create and update a <code>WebACL</code> that contains the <code>RateBasedRule</code>.

With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use. </note> When you want to create, update, or delete AWS WAF objects, get a change token and include the change token in the create, update, or delete request. Change tokens ensure that your application doesn't submit conflicting requests to AWS WAF. Each create, update, or delete request must use a unique change token. If your application submits a <code>GetChangeToken</code> request and then submits a second <code>GetChangeToken</code> request before submitting a create, update, or delete request, the second <code>GetChangeToken</code> request returns the same value as the first <code>GetChangeToken</code> request. When you use a change token in a create, update, or delete request, the status of the change token changes to <code>PENDING</code>, which indicates that AWS WAF is propagating the change to all AWS WAF servers. Use <code>GetChangeTokenStatus</code> to determine the status of your change token.

If you want to change an <code>IPSetDescriptor</code> object, you delete the existing object and add a new one. </li> <li> The IP address version, <code>IPv4</code> or <code>IPv6</code>. </li> <li> The IP address in CIDR notation, for example, <code>192.0.2.0/24</code> (for the range of IP addresses from <code>192.0.2.0</code> to <code>192.0.2.255</code>) or <code>192.0.2.44/32</code> (for the individual IP address <code>192.0.2.44</code>). </li> </ul> AWS WAF supports IPv4 address ranges: /8 and any range between /16 through /32. AWS WAF supports IPv6 address ranges: /24, /32, /48, /56, /64, and /128. For more information about CIDR notation, see the Wikipedia entry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing">Classless Inter-Domain Routing</a>. IPv6 addresses can be represented using any of the following formats: <ul> <li> 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128 </li> <li> 1111:0:0:0:0:0:0:0111/128 </li> <li> 1111::0111/128 </li> <li> 1111::111/128 </li> </ul> You use an <code>IPSet</code> to specify which web requests you want to allow or block based on the IP addresses that the requests originated from. For example, if you're receiving a lot of requests from one or a small number of IP addresses and you want to block the requests, you can create an <code>IPSet</code> that specifies those IP addresses, and then configure AWS WAF to block the requests. To create and configure an <code>IPSet</code>, perform the following steps: <ol> <li> Submit a <a>CreateIPSet</a> request. </li> <li> Use <a>GetChangeToken</a> to get the change token that you provide in the <code>ChangeToken</code> parameter of an <a>UpdateIPSet</a> request. </li> <li> Submit an <code>UpdateIPSet</code> request to specify the IP addresses that you want AWS WAF to watch for. </li> </ol> When you update an <code>IPSet</code>, you specify the IP addresses that you want to add and/or the IP addresses that you want to delete. If you want to change an IP address, you delete the existing IP address and add the new one. You can insert a maximum of 1000 addresses in a single request.

With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use. </note> Inserts or deletes <a>Predicate</a> objects in a rule and updates the <code>RateLimit</code> in the rule. Each <code>Predicate</code> object identifies a predicate, such as a <a>ByteMatchSet</a> or an <a>IPSet</a>, that specifies the web requests that you want to block or count. The <code>RateLimit</code> specifies the number of requests every five minutes that triggers the rule. If you add more than one predicate to a <code>RateBasedRule</code>, a request must match all the predicates and exceed the <code>RateLimit</code> to be counted or blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a <code>RateBasedRule</code>: <ul> <li> An <code>IPSet</code> that matches the IP address <code>192.0.2.44/32</code> </li> <li> A <code>ByteMatchSet</code> that matches <code>BadBot</code> in the <code>User-Agent</code> header </li> </ul> Further, you specify a <code>RateLimit</code> of 1,000. You then add the <code>RateBasedRule</code> to a <code>WebACL</code> and specify that you want to block requests that satisfy the rule. For a request to be blocked, it must come from the IP address 192.0.2.44 <i>and</i> the <code>User-Agent</code> header in the request must contain the value <code>BadBot</code>. Further, requests that match these two conditions much be received at a rate of more than 1,000 every five minutes. If the rate drops below this limit, AWS WAF no longer blocks the requests. As a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular page on your site. To do this, you could add the following to a <code>RateBasedRule</code>: <ul> <li> A <code>ByteMatchSet</code> with <code>FieldToMatch</code> of <code>URI</code> </li> <li> A <code>PositionalConstraint</code> of <code>STARTS_WITH</code> </li> <li> A <code>TargetString</code> of <code>login</code> </li> </ul> Further, you specify a <code>RateLimit</code> of 1,000. By adding this <code>RateBasedRule</code> to a <code>WebACL</code>, you could limit requests to your login page without affecting the rest of your site.

          <note> This is <b>AWS WAF Classic</b> documentation. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/classic-waf-chapter.html">AWS WAF Classic</a> in the developer guide. <b>For the latest version of AWS WAF</b>, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html">AWS WAF Developer Guide</a>. With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use. </note> Creates a <a>RateBasedRule</a>. The <code>RateBasedRule</code> contains a <code>RateLimit</code>, which specifies the maximum number of requests that AWS WAF allows from a specified IP address in a five-minute period. The <code>RateBasedRule</code> also contains the <code>IPSet</code> objects, <code>ByteMatchSet</code> objects, and other predicates that identify the requests that you want to count or block if these requests exceed the <code>RateLimit</code>. If you add more than one predicate to a <code>RateBasedRule</code>, a request not only must exceed the <code>RateLimit</code>, but it also must match all the conditions to be counted or blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a <code>RateBasedRule</code>: <ul> <li> An <code>IPSet</code> that matches the IP address <code>192.0.2.44/32</code> </li> <li> A <code>ByteMatchSet</code> that matches <code>BadBot</code> in the <code>User-Agent</code> header </li> </ul> Further, you specify a <code>RateLimit</code> of 1,000. You then add the <code>RateBasedRule</code> to a <code>WebACL</code> and specify that you want to block requests that meet the conditions in the rule. For a request to be blocked, it must come from the IP address 192.0.2.44 <i>and</i> the <code>User-Agent</code> header in the request must contain the value <code>BadBot</code>. Further, requests that match these two conditions must be received at a rate of more than 1,000 requests every five minutes. If both conditions are met and the rate is exceeded, AWS WAF blocks the requests. If the rate drops below 1,000 for a five-minute period, AWS WAF no longer blocks the requests. As a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular page on your site. To do this, you could add the following to a <code>RateBasedRule</code>: <ul> <li> A <code>ByteMatchSet</code> with <code>FieldToMatch</code> of <code>URI</code> </li> <li> A <code>PositionalConstraint</code> of <code>STARTS_WITH</code> </li> <li> A <code>TargetString</code> of <code>login</code> </li> </ul> Further, you specify a <code>RateLimit</code> of 1,000. By adding this <code>RateBasedRule</code> to a <code>WebACL</code>, you could limit requests to your login page without affecting the rest of your site. To create and configure a <code>RateBasedRule</code>, perform the following steps: <ol> <li> Create and update the predicates that you want to include in the rule. For more information, see <a>CreateByteMatchSet</a>, <a>CreateIPSet</a>, and <a>CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet</a>. </li> <li> Use <a>GetChangeToken</a> to get the change token that you provide in the <code>ChangeToken</code> parameter of a <code>CreateRule</code> request. </li> <li> Submit a <code>CreateRateBasedRule</code> request. </li> <li> Use <code>GetChangeToken</code> to get the change token that you provide in the <code>ChangeToken</code> parameter of an <a>UpdateRule</a> request. </li> <li> Submit an <code>UpdateRateBasedRule</code> request to specify the predicates that you want to include in the rule. </li> <li> Create and update a <code>WebACL</code> that contains the <code>RateBasedRule</code>.

With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use. </note> When you want to create, update, or delete AWS WAF objects, get a change token and include the change token in the create, update, or delete request. Change tokens ensure that your application doesn't submit conflicting requests to AWS WAF. Each create, update, or delete request must use a unique change token. If your application submits a <code>GetChangeToken</code> request and then submits a second <code>GetChangeToken</code> request before submitting a create, update, or delete request, the second <code>GetChangeToken</code> request returns the same value as the first <code>GetChangeToken</code> request. When you use a change token in a create, update, or delete request, the status of the change token changes to <code>PENDING</code>, which indicates that AWS WAF is propagating the change to all AWS WAF servers. Use <code>GetChangeTokenStatus</code> to determine the status of your change token.

You can specify a sample size of up to 500 requests, and you can specify any time range in the previous three hours. <code>GetSampledRequests</code> returns a time range, which is usually the time range that you specified. However, if your resource (such as a CloudFront distribution) received 5,000 requests before the specified time range elapsed, <code>GetSampledRequests</code> returns an updated time range. This new time range indicates the actual period during which AWS WAF selected the requests in the sample.

AWS WAF supports IPv6 address ranges: /24, /32, /48, /56, /64, and /128. For more information about CIDR notation, see the Wikipedia entry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing">Classless Inter-Domain Routing</a>. IPv6 addresses can be represented using any of the following formats: <ul> <li> 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128 </li> <li> 1111:0:0:0:0:0:0:0111/128 </li> <li> 1111::0111/128 </li> <li> 1111::111/128 </li> </ul> You use an <code>IPSet</code> to specify which web requests you want to allow or block based on the IP addresses that the requests originated from. For example, if you're receiving a lot of requests from one or a small number of IP addresses and you want to block the requests, you can create an <code>IPSet</code> that specifies those IP addresses, and then configure AWS WAF to block the requests.

Each <code>Predicate</code> object identifies a predicate, such as a <a>ByteMatchSet</a> or an <a>IPSet</a>, that specifies the web requests that you want to block or count. The <code>RateLimit</code> specifies the number of requests every five minutes that triggers the rule. If you add more than one predicate to a <code>RateBasedRule</code>, a request must match all the predicates and exceed the <code>RateLimit</code> to be counted or blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a <code>RateBasedRule</code>: <ul> <li> An <code>IPSet</code> that matches the IP address <code>192.0.2.44/32</code> </li> <li> A <code>ByteMatchSet</code> that matches <code>BadBot</code> in the <code>User-Agent</code> header </li> </ul> Further, you specify a <code>RateLimit</code> of 1,000. You then add the <code>RateBasedRule</code> to a <code>WebACL</code> and specify that you want to block requests that satisfy the rule. For a request to be blocked, it must come from the IP address 192.0.2.44 <i>and</i> the <code>User-Agent</code> header in the request must contain the value <code>BadBot</code>. Further, requests that match these two conditions much be received at a rate of more than 1,000 every five minutes. If the rate drops below this limit, AWS WAF no longer blocks the requests. As a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular page on your site. To do this, you could add the following to a <code>RateBasedRule</code>: <ul> <li> A <code>ByteMatchSet</code> with <code>FieldToMatch</code> of <code>URI</code> </li> <li> A <code>PositionalConstraint</code> of <code>STARTS_WITH</code> </li> <li> A <code>TargetString</code> of <code>login</code> </li> </ul> Further, you specify a <code>RateLimit</code> of 1,000. By adding this <code>RateBasedRule</code> to a <code>WebACL</code>, you could limit requests to your login page without affecting the rest of your site.

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Associates a web ACL with a regional application resource, to protect the resource. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, or an AppSync GraphQL API. For Amazon CloudFront, don't use this call. Instead, use your CloudFront distribution configuration. To associate a web ACL, in the CloudFront call <code>UpdateDistribution</code>, set the web ACL ID to the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL. For information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDistribution.html">UpdateDistribution</a>.

        <details>
          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Returns the web ACL capacity unit (WCU) requirements for a specified scope and set of rules. You can use this to check the capacity requirements for the rules you want to use in a <a>RuleGroup</a> or <a>WebACL</a>. WAF uses WCUs to calculate and control the operating resources that are used to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs. WAF calculates capacity differently for each rule type, to reflect the relative cost of each rule. Simple rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than more complex rules that use more processing power. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation, which helps users plan their web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule group. The WCU limit for web ACLs is 1,500.

          Creates a <a>RuleGroup</a> per the specifications provided. A rule group defines a collection of rules to inspect and control web requests that you can use in a <a>WebACL</a>. When you create a rule group, you define an immutable capacity limit. If you update a rule group, you must stay within the capacity. This allows others to reuse the rule group with confidence in its capacity requirements.

          <summary>Show Description</summary>
          Creates a <a>WebACL</a> per the specifications provided. A web ACL defines a collection of rules to use to inspect and control web requests. Each rule has an action defined (allow, block, or count) for requests that match the statement of the rule. In the web ACL, you assign a default action to take (allow, block) for any request that does not match any of the rules. The rules in a web ACL can be a combination of the types <a>Rule</a>, <a>RuleGroup</a>, and managed rule group. You can associate a web ACL with one or more Amazon Web Services resources to protect. The resources can be an Amazon CloudFront distribution, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer, or an AppSync GraphQL API.

          Retrieves the keys that are currently blocked by a rate-based rule instance. The maximum number of managed keys that can be blocked for a single rate-based rule instance is 10,000. If more than 10,000 addresses exceed the rate limit, those with the highest rates are blocked. For a rate-based rule that you've defined inside a rule group, provide the name of the rule group reference statement in your request, in addition to the rate-based rule name and the web ACL name. WAF monitors web requests and manages keys independently for each unique combination of web ACL, optional rule group, and rate-based rule. For example, if you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use the rule group in a web ACL, WAF monitors web requests and manages keys for that web ACL, rule group reference statement, and rate-based rule instance. If you use the same rule group in a second web ACL, WAF monitors web requests and manages keys for this second usage completely independent of your first.

You can specify a sample size of up to 500 requests, and you can specify any time range in the previous three hours. <code>GetSampledRequests</code> returns a time range, which is usually the time range that you specified. However, if your resource (such as a CloudFront distribution) received 5,000 requests before the specified time range elapsed, <code>GetSampledRequests</code> returns an updated time range. This new time range indicates the actual period during which WAF selected the requests in the sample.

          Creates an IP access control group. An IP access control group provides you with the ability to control the IP addresses from which users are allowed to access their WorkSpaces. To specify the CIDR address ranges, add rules to your IP access control group and then associate the group with your directory. You can add rules when you create the group or at any time using <a>AuthorizeIpRules</a>. There is a default IP access control group associated with your directory. If you don't associate an IP access control group with your directory, the default group is used. The default group includes a default rule that allows users to access their WorkSpaces from anywhere. You cannot modify the default IP access control group for your directory.

          Creates a rule to control sampling behavior for instrumented applications. Services retrieve rules with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_GetSamplingRules.html">GetSamplingRules</a>, and evaluate each rule in ascending order of <i>priority</i> for each request. If a rule matches, the service records a trace, borrowing it from the reservoir size. After 10 seconds, the service reports back to X-Ray with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_GetSamplingTargets.html">GetSamplingTargets</a> to get updated versions of each in-use rule. The updated rule contains a trace quota that the service can use instead of borrowing from the reservoir.

          Retrieves IDs and annotations for traces available for a specified time frame using an optional filter. To get the full traces, pass the trace IDs to <code>BatchGetTraces</code>. A filter expression can target traced requests that hit specific service nodes or edges, have errors, or come from a known user. For example, the following filter expression targets traces that pass through <code>api.example.com</code>: <code>service("api.example.com")</code> This filter expression finds traces that have an annotation named <code>account</code> with the value <code>12345</code>: <code>annotation.account = "12345"</code> For a full list of indexed fields and keywords that you can use in filter expressions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-console-filters.html">Using Filter Expressions</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services X-Ray Developer Guide</i>.

          Uploads segment documents to Amazon Web Services X-Ray. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/index.html">X-Ray SDK</a> generates segment documents and sends them to the X-Ray daemon, which uploads them in batches. A segment document can be a completed segment, an in-progress segment, or an array of subsegments. Segments must include the following fields. For the full segment document schema, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-api-segmentdocuments.html">Amazon Web Services X-Ray Segment Documents</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services X-Ray Developer Guide</i>. <p class="title"> <b>Required segment document fields</b> <ul> <li> <code>name</code> - The name of the service that handled the request. </li> <li> <code>id</code> - A 64-bit identifier for the segment, unique among segments in the same trace, in 16 hexadecimal digits. </li> <li> <code>trace_id</code> - A unique identifier that connects all segments and subsegments originating from a single client request. </li> <li> <code>start_time</code> - Time the segment or subsegment was created, in floating point seconds in epoch time, accurate to milliseconds. For example, <code>1480615200.010</code> or <code>1.480615200010E9</code>. </li> <li> <code>end_time</code> - Time the segment or subsegment was closed. For example, <code>1480615200.090</code> or <code>1.480615200090E9</code>. Specify either an <code>end_time</code> or <code>in_progress</code>. </li> <li> <code>in_progress</code> - Set to <code>true</code> instead of specifying an <code>end_time</code> to record that a segment has been started, but is not complete. Send an in-progress segment when your application receives a request that will take a long time to serve, to trace that the request was received. When the response is sent, send the complete segment to overwrite the in-progress segment. </li> </ul> A <code>trace_id</code> consists of three numbers separated by hyphens. For example, 1-58406520-a006649127e371903a2de979. This includes: <p class="title"> <b>Trace ID Format</b> <ul> <li> The version number, for instance, <code>1</code>. </li> <li> The time of the original request, in Unix epoch time, in 8 hexadecimal digits. For example, 10:00AM December 2nd, 2016 PST in epoch time is <code>1480615200</code> seconds, or <code>58406520</code> in hexadecimal. </li> <li> A 96-bit identifier for the trace, globally unique, in 24 hexadecimal digits. </li> </ul>
