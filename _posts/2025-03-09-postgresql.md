PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that offers robust replication features. In this guide, we will set up master-slave replication on Debian, ensuring data is synchronized across servers for redundancy and high availability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:
- ‚úÖ Two Debian-based servers (Master & Slave)
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL installed on both servers
- ‚úÖ SSH access with sudo privileges
- ‚úÖ Proper network connectivity between the servers
- ‚úÖ Static IP addresses assigned to both servers

## üì• Step 1: Install PostgreSQL on Both Servers

Run the following commands on both Master and Slave servers:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

Once installed, verify the PostgreSQL service:

```bash
sudo systemctl status postgresql
```

![psql](/assets/linux/psql/psql1.png){: width="800" height="500" }

## üèóÔ∏è Step 2: Configure PostgreSQL on Master

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Edit postgresql.conf
Modify the PostgreSQL configuration file on the Master Server  

> where XX is the version number
{: .prompt-info }

```bash
sudo nano /etc/postgresql/XX/main/postgresql.conf
```

Update the following parameters:

```
listen_addresses = '*'  # Allows remote connections
wal_level = replica     # Enables replication
archive_mode = on       # Enables WAL archiving
archive_command = 'cp %p /var/lib/postgresql/archive/%f'
max_wal_senders = 10    # Defines maximum WAL senders
wal_keep_size = 64MB    # Retains WAL segments
hot_standby = on        # "off" disallows queries during recovery
```

Restart PostgreSQL to apply changes:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
```

![psql](/assets/linux/psql/psql2.png){: width="800" height="500" }

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure pg_hba conf

The `pg_hba.conf` (PostgreSQL Host-Based Authentication) file is used to control client authentication in PostgreSQL. It defines who can connect, from where, and how they authenticate.

Allow replication connections from the Slave Server:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/postgresql/XX/main/pg_hba.conf
```

#### üî∑ Types of Authentication in PostgreSQL

1Ô∏è‚É£ Trust
- Description: Allows connections without a password.
- Use Case: Only for local testing or environments with strict network isolation.
```bash
host all all 192.168.1.0/24 trust
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ MD5 (Hashed Password)
- Description: Uses MD5-hashed passwords for authentication.
- Use Case: Recommended for remote connections with password authentication.
```bash
host all all 192.168.1.0/24 md5
```

> MD5 is considered weak by modern security standards. Use `scram-sha-256` if possible.
{: .prompt-info }

3Ô∏è‚É£ Password (Plaintext Password)
- Description: Requires a plain-text password.
- Use Case: Not recommended for security reasons sends unencrypted passwords over the network (not secure).
```bash
host all all 192.168.1.0/24 password
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ Scram-SHA-256 (Secure Hashed Authentication)
- Description: Uses SHA-256 hashing (stronger than MD5).
- Use Case: Recommended for secure remote authentication.
```bash
host all all 192.168.1.0/24 scram-sha-256
```
‚úÖ More secure than MD5 because it uses salted hashing and protects against brute-force attacks.


5Ô∏è‚É£ Peer (Linux User Mapping)
- Description: Uses the system‚Äôs OS user for authentication.
- Use Case: Secure local authentication on Unix/Linux.
- PostgreSQL checks if the OS username matches the DB username.
```bash
local all all peer
```

6Ô∏è‚É£ Ident (Remote OS User Mapping)
- Description: Uses an external Ident server to verify usernames.
- Use Case: Used when clients and DB servers are on the same trusted network.
- Maps OS users to database users.
```bash
host all all 192.168.1.0/24 ident
```

7Ô∏è‚É£ LDAP, Kerberos, PAM, SSPI, GSSAPI, Cert

- Use Case: Enterprise environments needing single sign-on (SSO) or centralized authentication.
```bash
host all all 192.168.1.0/24 ldap
host all all 192.168.1.0/24 gss
```


Which Authentication Method Should You Use?

| Method                | Security       | Best Use Case                                    |
|-----------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Trust**            | ‚ùå Insecure    | Local testing only                              |
| **MD5**              | üü° Moderate    | Legacy remote authentication                    |
| **Password**         | ‚ùå Weak        | Avoid if possible                              |
| **Scram-SHA-256**    | ‚úÖ Strong      | Secure password authentication                  |
| **Peer**             | ‚úÖ Secure      | Local authentication on Linux                   |
| **Ident**            | üü° Moderate    | Trusted networks with Ident server              |
| **LDAP, Kerberos, PAM** | ‚úÖ Enterprise-grade | Large organizations needing SSO          |


Add the autheantication methhos depending upon your needs:
```
host   Rule   User       Address      authentication
host replication replicator <SLAVE_IP>/32 Scram-SHA-256
```

Restart PostgreSQL again:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
```

## üîê Step 3: Create a Replication User

Create a dedicated user for replication:
```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
    (OR)
su - postgres && psql
```

Within the PostgreSQL shell, execute:
```bash
CREATE USER replicator REPLICATION LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'super_secure_password';
```

Exit the PostgreSQL shell:
```bash
\q
```

![psql](/assets/linux/psql/psql4.png){: width="800" height="500" }

## üì• Step 4: Configure the Slave Server

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Stop PostgreSQL Service
Run the following command on the Slave Server:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop postgresql
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sync Data from Master
Clear the existing data directory:

> where XX is the version number
{: .prompt-info }

```
sudo mv /var/lib/postgresql/XX/main /var/lib/postgresql/XX/main_bak
                      (or)
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/postgresql/XX/main/*
```

Sync data from the Master to the Slave using `rsync`:

```bash
sudo -u postgres rsync -av --progress -e "ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa" postgres@<MASTER_IP>:/var/lib/postgresql/XX/main/ /var/lib/postgresql/XX/main/
        (OR)
su - postgres
rsync -laze "ssh -p 22" $USER$@$IP$:/var/lib/postgresql/15/main /var/lib/postgresql/15/
```

![psql](/assets/linux/psql/psql5.png){: width="800" height="500" }

> - As we have used the rsync whcih dont have Streaming WAL Files options. rsync is useful for initial database syncs or backups, especially for large datasets. However, it needs more manual steps and is not suited for continuous replication. 
> - For ongoing replication, Streaming WAL Files is the better choice as it provides real-time updates, is easy to set up, and requires less manual work. It's ideal for high availability and scaling.
> - Use Streaming WAL Files for regular replication and rsync for one-time tasks or custom backups.
{: .prompt-warning }

```bash
pg_basebackup -h <master_ip> -U replicator -p 5432 -D /var/lib/postgresql/<version>/main -v -X stream -C -S slaveslot1 -R
SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots;
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Recovery Configuration File
Create a standby.signal file:
```bash
touch /var/lib/postgresql/XX/main/standby.signal
```

Create a postgresql.auto.conf file:
```bash
sudo nano /var/lib/postgresql/XX/main/postgresql.auto.conf
```

Add the following lines:
```bash
primary_conninfo = 'host=<MASTER_IP> port=5432 user=replicator password=super_secure_password'
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start PostgreSQL on Slave
Restart PostgreSQL on the Slave Server:
```bash
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

![psql](/assets/linux/psql/psql6.png){: width="800" height="500" }

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 5: Verify Replication

On the Master Server, run:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;"
```

On the Slave Server, run:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_wal_receiver;"
```

If replication is working, you should see active WAL sender and receiver processes.

## üî• Sync vs Async

Synchronous vs Asynchronous Replication in PostgreSQL

When setting up PostgreSQL replication, understanding the difference between synchronous and asynchronous replication is crucial. These two modes define how the primary (master) server and the standby (replica) server communicate and how transactions are managed across them.

### üì° Synchronous Replication

In synchronous replication, the primary server waits for the standby server to acknowledge that it has received and written the WAL (Write-Ahead Log) data before the transaction is considered committed. This ensures data consistency across servers and reduces the risk of data loss, as both the primary and replica are in sync after each transaction.
- Pros:
    - Data Consistency: Guarantees that both primary and replica are always in sync.
    - Fault Tolerance: Lower risk of data loss in the event of a failure.
- Cons:
    - Higher Latency: Transactions may experience a slight delay because the primary waits for the standby‚Äôs acknowledgment.
    - Performance Impact: Can slow down transactions, especially when the replica is located far away or is slower.

Use Case: Synchronous replication is ideal for mission-critical applications where data consistency and high availability are more important than performance.

### üì° Asynchronous Replication

In asynchronous replication, the primary server does not wait for the standby server to acknowledge the receipt of WAL data. The primary server commits the transaction immediately and continues without waiting for the replica to catch up. This results in faster transaction processing but introduces a risk of data loss if the primary server fails before the replica has received and written the data.
- Pros:
    - Lower Latency: Transactions are faster since the primary doesn‚Äôt wait for the replica.
    - Better Performance: Especially beneficial when the replica is located remotely or when replication lag isn‚Äôt a major concern.
- Cons:
    - Risk of Data Loss: If the primary fails, recent transactions may not have been replicated, leading to data inconsistency.
    - Replication Lag: The replica may not always be up-to-date with the primary server.

Use Case: Asynchronous replication is suitable for systems where performance is critical, and slight data inconsistency is acceptable, such as read-heavy applications or when using geographically distributed systems.

The choice between synchronous and asynchronous replication depends on the needs of your application. If data integrity and consistency are paramount, then synchronous replication is the way to go. However, if performance and low latency are more important, asynchronous replication may be better suited for your use case.

Edit the PostgreSQL Configuration on the Primary (Master) Server:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/postgresql/<version>/main/postgresql.conf
synchronous_standby_names = '*'
sudo systemctl reload postgresql
sudo -u postgres psql -c "SHOW synchronous_standby_names;"
```

## üîÑ Testing Replication

To confirm replication is working:

1. Create a test database on Master:
```bash
CREATE DATABASE testdb;
```

2. Check if it appears on Slave:
```bash
\l
```
