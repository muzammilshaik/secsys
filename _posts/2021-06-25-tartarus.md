We are going to solve an CTF challenge called the tartarus. This is a beginner box based on simple enumeration of services and basic privilege escalation techniques. We have 3 port open FTP , SSH & HTTP. We do brute force with hydra to login as www-data and upload a reverse shell to connect into the box

We will start with rust scan to find the open ports 

![tartarus0](/assets/ctf/tartarus/tartarus_0.png){: width="800" height="500" } || ![tartarus1](/assets/ctf/tartarus/tartarus_1.png){: width="800" height="500" }

As the port 80 is open let’s fire the nikto and save the output to a file nikto.log

![tartarus2](/assets/ctf/tartarus/tartarus_2.png){: width="800" height="500" }

nikto had find the robots.txt lets open it and we have a secret admin directory. and we found users id and credentials let’s download it with wget 

![tartarus3](/assets/ctf/tartarus/tartarus_3.png){: width="800" height="500" }

As the FTP SERVER allows anonymous login let’s login as anonymous 

![tartarus4](/assets/ctf/tartarus/tartarus_4.png){: width="800" height="500" }

we found the super secret directory. let’s run the gobuster to find more directories 

![tartarus5](/assets/ctf/tartarus/tartarus_5.png){: width="800" height="500" }

we found the login page at /super-secret and we have users id and credentials let’s run the HYDRA  to get the valid user and password 

`hydra IP -L userid -P credentials.txt http-post-form "/sUp3r-s3cr3t/authenticate.php/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:F=Incorrect*"`

![tartarus6](/assets/ctf/tartarus/tartarus_6.png){: width="800" height="500" } || ![tartarus7](/assets/ctf/tartarus/tartarus_7.png){: width="800" height="500" }

we are having a upload page. Let’s upload a php-reverse-shell to get the shell. We found it in /super secret /images/uploads

![tartarus9](/assets/ctf/tartarus/tartarus_9.png){: width="800" height="500" }

let’s open the port and wait for the connection. Am using pwncat tool for listening you can find the pwncat in GitHub

![tartarus10](/assets/ctf/tartarus/tartarus_10.png){: width="800" height="500" }

we are into the box as the www-data user let’s check if we have the sudo permission to the user `sudo -l`

![tartarus11](/assets/ctf/tartarus/tartarus_11.png){: width="800" height="500" }

our user may run the gdb as thirtytwo user with out the password. 

`sudo -u thirtytwo /var/www/gdb -nx -ex '!sh' -ex quit`

![tartarus12](/assets/ctf/tartarus/tartarus_12.png){: width="800" height="500" }

we are the thirtytwo user now and let’s check what sudo permissions we have darckh user who may run the git with out root password 

`sudo -u d4rckh /usr/bin/git help config`

![tartarus13](/assets/ctf/tartarus/tartarus_13.png){: width="800" height="500" }

A little bit of enumeration we had find that we can write the cleanup.py script we edit the script to give us the setuid binary to the darckh user so that we can have root permission

`chmod +s /bin/bash`

![tartarus14](/assets/ctf/tartarus/tartarus_14.png){: width="800" height="500" }

That's all for to day hope you like the box see you i next tutorial until then good bye have  a great day
