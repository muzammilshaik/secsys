This is a continuation from Part 3 of the Bandit Wargame series. If you haven’t checked out [Part 2 blog]({% post_url 2025-01-25-bandit-2 %}){:target="_blank"}, I highly recommend giving it a read before proceeding, as it covers foundational skills essential for tackling these levels.

Now, let’s pick up where we left off and dive deeper into the challenges, starting from Bandit Level 11. These levels will introduce more advanced concepts, helping you sharpen your Linux skills further. 

Let’s get started!

## Bandit Level 20 → Level 21
**Level Goal**

There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

> Note: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think

## Bandit Level 21 → Level 22
**Level Goal**

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

```
bandit21@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat *
@reboot bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null

bandit21@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
#!/bin/bash
chmod 644 /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 > /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv

bandit21@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
tRae0UfB9v0UzbCdn9cY0gQnds9GF58Q

bandit21@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ 
```

**Explanation**
- The script is a cron job that runs automatically at set intervals.
- It performs two actions:
  - Sets the file permissions of /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv to 644 (readable by everyone but writable only by the owner).
  - Copies the content of the file /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 (which contains the password for bandit22) into /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv.

## Bandit Level 22 → Level 23
**Level Goal**

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

> Note: Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.
{: .prompt-info }

```
bandit22@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget

bandit22@bandit:~$ echo "I am user bandit23" | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1

0Zf11ioIjMVN551jX3CmStKLYqjk54Ga
bandit22@bandit:~$
```

## Bandit Level 23 → Level 24
Level Goal

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

> **Note:** This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!  
> **Note:** Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy around…  
{: .prompt-info }

```
bandit23@bandit:$ cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit24

cd /var/spool/$myname/foo
echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname/foo:"
for i in * .*;
do
    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];
    then
        echo "Handling $i"
        owner="$(stat --format "%U" ./$i)"
        if [ "${owner}" = "bandit23" ]; then
            timeout -s 9 60 ./$i
        fi
        rm -f ./$i
    fi
done

bandit23@bandit:$

bandit23@bandit:/tmp/t00$ cat payload.sh
#!/bin/bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/t00/passwd

bandit23@bandit:/tmp/t00$ touch passwd && chmod 777 passwd
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/t00$ cp payload.sh /var/spool/bandit24/foo/
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/t00$ cat passwd
gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/t00$
```

**Explanation**
- The cron job file (`/etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit24`) runs a script (`/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh`) as the user `bandit24`.
- The cron job executes every minute (`* * * * * bandit24`) and on reboot (`@reboot bandit24`).
- The script processes files in `/var/spool/bandit24/foo/` and executes them if they are owned by `bandit23`.
- Since we lack permission to read `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit24`, we created a script (`payload.sh`) that writes the password to a readable file (`/tmp/t00/passwd`) and placed it in the monitored directory (`/var/spool/bandit24/foo/`).
- The cron job executed `payload.sh`, allowing us to retrieve the password.

## 
Bandit Level 24 → Level 25
**Level Goal**

A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.
You do not need to create new connections each time

```
bandit24@bandit:/tmp/tmp.89890$ for i in $(seq -f "%04g" 0 9999); do   echo "$(cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24) $i"; done >> pass.txt  

bandit24@bandit:/tmp/tmp.89890$ head -n 3 pass.txt && cat pass.txt | wc -l
gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 0000
gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 0001
gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 0002
10000

bandit24@bandit:/tmp/tmp.89890$ cat pass.txt | nc localhost 30002 > out.txt 
bandit24@bandit:/tmp/tmp.89890$ cat out.txt | grep -v "Wrong!"
I am the pincode checker for user bandit25. Please enter the password for user bandit24 and the secret pincode on a single line, separated by a space.
Correct!
The password of user bandit25 is iCi86ttT4KSNe1armKiwbQNmB3YJP3q4

bandit24@bandit:/tmp/tmp.89890$
```

**Explanation**
- We have generated range of password pincode combination pairs in the `pass.txt` file, where the password for `bandit24` is paired with each 4-digit combination.
- The total number of entries in `pass.txt` was confirmed using `cat pass.txt | wc -l`, which showed 10,000 entries.
- The contents of `pass.txt` were piped to `nc` (netcat) to send the password-pincode pairs to a service running on `localhost` on port `30002`
- After filtering the responses, the correct password for `bandit25` was identified.

## Bandit Level 25 → Level 26
**Level Goal**

Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy… The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.


> Note: if you’re a Windows user and typically use Powershell to ssh into bandit: Powershell is known to cause issues with the intended solution to this level. You should use command prompt instead.

![bandit](/assets/ctf/community/overthewire/Bandit/bandit3.png){: width="800" height="500" } || ![bandit](/assets/ctf/community/overthewire/Bandit/bandit4.png){: width="800" height="500" }

**Explanation**

- In this level, it was crucial to `think outside the box` to overcome the challenge. Initially, various commands were tried to break out of the restricted shell and gain access, but none of them worked. After several attempts, it became clear that traditional methods wouldn't work, so the next step was to consult a cheat sheet for insights and alternative approaches to bypass the restrictions.
- As the script is executing the more is displaying the banner we need to fully zoom the screen so that the more goes into command line 
- Once the command line was visible, the next step was to press the `v` key. Pressing v within the more environment switched the interface into `vim mode`, a text editor that allows for more interactive control over the terminal. In vim, users have the ability to edit files, navigate within them, and execute commands. To proceed, the file containing the password for the next level could be accessed by entering the command `:e /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26`. This command opened the password file, revealing the password for bandit26, which could then be used to log in to the next level and continue progressing through the challenge

## Bandit Level 26 → Level 27
**Level Goal**

Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!

```
$ ls
bandit27-do  text.txt
$ file bandit27-do
bandit27-do: setuid ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=368cd8ac4633fabdf3f4fb1c47a250634d6a8347, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
$ ./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit\_pass/bandit27
upsNCc7vzaRDx6oZC6GiR6ERwe1MowGB
$ ./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27
upsNCc7vzaRDx6oZC6GiR6ERwe1MowGB
$
```

![bandit](/assets/ctf/community/overthewire/Bandit/bandit5.1.png){: width="800" height="500" }

**Explanation**
- The `bandit26` user cannot log in directly through SSH due to the restricted shell. The shell for the user is set as `/usr/bin/showtext` as shown in the `/etc/passwd` entry:  `bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext`.
- Access to a shell can be gained by exploiting the `vim` binary using the technique found in [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/vim/#shell){:target="_blank"}. This allows spawning an interactive shell despite the restrictions.
- After obtaining shell access, it is possible to inspect the directory and find a file named `bandit27-do`. This file is a **setuid binary** that can execute commands as the `bandit27` user. The file details can be confirmed using the `file` command:  
- The `bandit27-do` binary can be used to read the contents of `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit27`, which contains the password for the `bandit27` user. The password can be retrieved by running the following command:  `./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27`.
- The output will reveal the password for the next level:  `upsNCc7vzaRDx6oZC6GiR6ERwe1MowGB`.

## Bandit Level 27 → Level 28
**Level Goal**

There is a git repository at ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit27-git is the same as for the user bandit27.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

# Bandit Notes
Some notes for level29 of bandit.

## credentials

- username: bandit29
- password: 4pT1t5DENaYuqnqvadYs1oE4QLCdjmJ7

bandit28@bandit:/tmp/tmp-67890/repo$

```

**Theory**
- `git log` shows us the commit log.
- `git show <commit>` shows us the content of a commit (When creating a public repository it is important to be aware of the information you push to it since changes and previous versions are saved. So sensitive data, like passwords, could still be retrieved).

**Explanation**  

- The Git repository was cloned using the following command:  
  `git clone "ssh://bandit28-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit28-git/repo"`.  
  This command connects to the repository using the specified SSH protocol and port `2220`. After cloning, the repository contained a single file named `README.md`.

- Upon inspecting the `README.md` file using `cat README.md`, it was discovered that the file contained obfuscated credentials for level 29. These credentials were intentionally hidden in the latest commit.

- The commit history of the repository was checked using the `git log` command. This command displayed the history of commits, including their hashes, authors, and timestamps. Three commits were identified in the log:
  - The first commit: Initial commit of the `README.md`.
  - The second commit: Added missing data.
  - The third commit: Fixed an information leak.

- Each commit was checked individually by using the `git checkout <commit-hash>` command to switch to a specific commit. The file content in each commit was then examined.

  - In the first commit, the file contained no relevant information.  
  - In the second commit, the credentials for level 29 were revealed in the `README.md` file as follows:  

    ```
    - username: bandit29  
    - password: 4pT1t5DENaYuqnqvadYs1oE4QLCdjmJ7  
    ```  

  - The third commit had the credentials obfuscated.

- By analyzing the commit history and accessing previous commits, the hidden credentials were successfully retrieved.

```

**Theory**:

**Git branching** is another feature of the version control system. It allows you to split the development into different branches. Specifically, there is a master branch from which the software can be taken and it can be separately worked on. You can change and add features while still maintaining a working master branch. Once the work is done, it can be integrated into the master branch again. This allows for additional version control. You can offer a production branch with usable software, while fixing bugs or adding features in a different development branch.

The basic commands for working with branches are:
  - git branch: List (-a), create, or delete branches
  - git checkout <branch_name>/git switch <branch_name>: Switch branches
  - git merge: Join two or more branches

**Explanation**
- After cloning the Git repository, the `README.md` file did not contain the password as it mentioned "no passwords in production!".
- The remote repository was inspected using the `git remote show origin` command, which revealed multiple branches: `master`, `dev`, and `sploits-dev`.
- The `dev` branch was identified as a possible source of the credentials. 
- By switching to the `dev` branch using `git checkout dev`, the password for the next level was found in the `README.md` file.

secret

```

**Theory:**


**Git tagging** is a way to mark specific points in the history of the repository. One example would be to mark release points of the software. The command to see the tags is git tag. To create a tag the command is git tag -a <tag_name> -m <"tag description/message">. To see more details, like the tag message and commit, you can use the following command: git show <tag_name>.

**Explanation**
- After cloning the Git repository, the `README.md` file was found to be empty with a humorous message "just an empty file... muahaha".
- Upon inspecting the repository, the `git tag` command revealed the presence of a tag named `secret`.
- Using `git show secret`, the password for the next level was revealed as `fb5S2xb7bRyFmAvQYQGEqsbhVyJqhnDy`.

## Bandit Level 31 → Level 32
**Level Goal**

There is a git repository at ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit31-git is the same as for the user bandit31.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

```
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/mp-1234$ git clone "ssh://bandit31-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit31-git/repo"

**Theory**
**Git Ignore** is a file with the filename `.gitignore`. In this file, all file names/extensions that should be ignored by the commit are written. This means if a file which is in the ignore file is created/changed, it will not be part of the commit/repository. Git ignore also allows for wildcards. (For example, : `*.txt` means all files with the ending `.txt` will be ignored.).

```

**Explanation**
- After cloning the Git repository, the `README.md` file specified that the task was to push a file named `key.txt` with the content "May I come in?" to the remote repository on the `master` branch.
- A new file named `key.txt` was created with the required content, and the changes were staged using `git add * -f`.
- The status confirmed that the changes were staged and ready to be committed.
- The file was committed with the message "let me in" and pushed to the remote repository using `git push`.
- Upon successful push, the remote server returned a message indicating successful validation and revealed the password for the next level: `3O9RfhqyAlVBEZpVb6LYStshZoqoSx5K`.

## Bandit Level 32 → Level 33
**Level Goal**

After all this git stuff, it’s time for another escape. Good luck!

**Theory**
A **restricted shell** is used to enforce a controlled environment for users, restricting access to certain commands (like `cd`, `exec`, and `set`), limiting the ability to execute scripts or binaries outside of designated directories, and preventing access to sensitive system information. It's often used in CTF challenges and for users that need to be isolated from the broader system to minimize security risks or to focus on specific tasks.

When logging into an SSH session, the prompt `>>` indicates that the user is operating in a **restricted shell** environment. A restricted shell limits what the user can do and restricts access to certain commands and functionalities. The purpose of such an environment is to limit a user's actions and provide them only with the essential tools to complete specific tasks, often as part of a security or challenge setup, such as in CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges.

The restricted shell, often used in certain scenarios like system hardening, prevents the execution of potentially dangerous or unnecessary commands and can force the user into a particular context or program. In this case, `>>` is used to signify that the user is likely in a **custom shell** or controlled environment, which may not offer full bash or shell functionality.

**Explanation:**
- After logging into the SSH session, the `>>` prompt indicates that the user is in a restricted shell. This is typically set up for certain users to limit the available commands and actions that can be performed.
- The prompt `>>` often suggests that the user is not in a normal shell, but instead in a controlled environment where commands are either restricted or filtered.
- The `whoami` command confirms that the user is `bandit33`.
- The `cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33` command reveals the password for the next level, `tQdtbs5D5i2vJwkO8mEyYEyTL8izoeJ0`, which will be used for authentication in the next level.
