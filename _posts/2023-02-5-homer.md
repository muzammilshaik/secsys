Recently I have decided to get my home network in order, One of the things I realized was that I spend a lot of time trying to remember the IP addresses or URLs for services within my home, especially ones that I access infrequently.

After searching for some open source projects i came across the homer. A simple to use Docker container that stores all my service url which can be accessible easily. Homer is a full static html/js dashboard, based on a simple yaml configuration file

## Prerequisites

1. [Docker]({% post_url 2023-01-15-docker %}){:target="_blank"} Engine and [Docker]({% post_url 2023-01-15-docker %}){:target="_blank"} Compose packages are installed and running
2. A non-root user with [Docker]({% post_url 2023-01-15-docker %}){:target="_blank"} privileges

## Setting up the homer

### Create the directory structure

To keep the docker directory clean i have created a homer directory to store the configuration file and any other assets such as images. My file structure is as follows:

```bash
mkdir ~/docker/homer/assets
touch ~/docker/homer/assets/config.yml ~/docker/homer/docker-compose.yml
```
```
ðŸ“‚homer
|-- ðŸ“‚assets
|   |-- ðŸ“‘config.yml
|-- ðŸ“‘docker-compose.yml  
```

### Docker Configuration 

As we have created the docker compose file lets edit the files with your favorite editors of choice

```yaml
---
version: "3"
services:
  homer:
    image: b4bz/homer
    container_name: homer
    volumes:
      - ./assets/:/www/assets
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    #networks:
    #  - proxy
    restart: unless-stopped
    user: 1000:1000 # default
    environment:
      - INIT_ASSETS=1 # default

#networks:
#  proxy:
#    external: true
```

As you notice am using the port 8080 if the port 8080 is already used feel free to use the free port. if you want to create a separate network for the homer (eg:- proxy) don't forget to create the docker network manually `docker network create proxy`


## Verify and launch the container 

to verify the docker compose files has no issues use `docker compose config` Once you have the `docker-compose.yml` file you can run `docker-compose up -d` which will create the volume, download the image and start the container in the background 

To verify the status of all running containers, run the docker-compose command:

```bash
docker-compose ps (OR) docker ps -a
```

If something goes wrong, you can check the logs for each container using the docker logs command and specify the service name. For example, to check the log of the Nginx Proxy Manager container, run the following command:

```bash
docker logs $container (OR) docker compose logs -f
```

## Accessing the Homer dashboard

Now that the container is up and running you can access it via:

```url
http://<docker-host-ip-address>:<port>
```

If everything has worked as expected you should see the following demo dashboard:

![dashboard](/assets/docker/homer/dash.png){: width="800" height="500" }

You can use the [Nginx proxy manager]({% post_url 2023-01-19-npm %}){:target="_blank"} to create the reverse proxy and configure the lets-encrypt SSL certificate to remove the SSL warnings

## Custom Themes

You can add custom CSS to homer in order to have a personal look similar to the one I have used from Walkxcode called [homer-theme](https://github.com/walkxcode/homer-theme){:target="_blank"}
