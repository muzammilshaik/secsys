## Steps to Install DietPi:

### 1. **Download the Image**: 

Visit the [DietPi download page](https://dietpi.com/#downloadinfo){:target="_blank"} and select your device. 

### 2. **Flash the Image**: 

Use tools like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/){:target="_blank"}, [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/){:target="_blank"}, or [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/){:target="_blank"} to write the DietPi image to an SD card or USB drive.  
For this process, I am using **Rufus** to flash the DietPi image to the SD card.  

Steps:
- **Download Rufus**: Go to the [Rufus website](https://rufus.ie/en/) and download the tool.
-  **Insert SD Card or USB Drive**: Plug in your SD card or USB drive into your computer.
-  **Select the DietPi Image**: Open Rufus and select the DietPi image you want to flash.
-  **Start Flashing**: Click on 'Start' to write the DietPi image onto your SD card or USB drive.

Once the image is written, follow the next steps to configure your network settings.

- **Update Network Configuration**:
  - Open the `dietpi.txt` file in your favorite text editor.
  - Update the network settings based on your preferences. In this example, I am using a Class A network at home and updated accordingly.

```bash
##### Network options #####
# Enable Ethernet or WiFi adapter: 1=enable | 0=disable
# - If both Ethernet and WiFi are enabled, WiFi will take priority and Ethernet will be disabled.
# - If using WiFi, please edit dietpi-wifi.txt to pre-enter credentials.
AUTO_SETUP_NET_ETHERNET_ENABLED=1
AUTO_SETUP_NET_WIFI_ENABLED=1

AUTO_SETUP_NET_WIFI_SSID=muju
AUTO_SETUP_NET_WIFI_KEY=XXXXXXXXXX

# WiFi country code: 2 capital letter value (e.g. GB US DE JP): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2
# - NB: This choice may be overridden if the WiFi access point sends a country code.
AUTO_SETUP_NET_WIFI_COUNTRY_CODE=GB

# Enter your static network details below, if applicable.
AUTO_SETUP_NET_USESTATIC=0
AUTO_SETUP_NET_STATIC_IP=XX.XX.XX.XX
AUTO_SETUP_NET_STATIC_MASK=XXX.XXX.XXX.o
AUTO_SETUP_NET_STATIC_GATEWAY=XX.XX.XX.XX
AUTO_SETUP_NET_STATIC_DNS=8.8.8.8 9.9.9.9 
```

- Modify Wi-Fi Configuration: Open the `dietpi-wifi.txt` file and modify the Wi-Fi settings.

```bash
aWIFI_SSID[0]='muju'
aWIFI_KEY[0]='XXXXXXXXXX'
```

- Save Changes: Save the changes you made to the `dietpi.txt` and `dietpi-wifi.txt` files.

### 3. **Boot Your Device**: 

Insert the SD card/USB into your device and boot it up. Wait for DietPi to complete some initial setup steps. Follow the on-screen prompts to configure your DietPi installation.

### 4. **Customize Your Setup**: 

DietPi also comes pre-installed with Dropbear SSH Server.

```bash
username = root
password = dietpi
```

Use `dietpi-software` to install additional applications as per your needs.

#### 1. **Login to the Server via SSH**
   - Log in to your DietPi server using SSH:
     ```bash
     ssh root@<your-server-ip>
     ```
   - Once logged in, execute the following to start installing applications:
     ```bash
     dietpi-software
     ```

#### 2. **Search for Webmin Package**
   - After running `dietpi-software`, search for the **Webmin** package by typing its name.
   - Webmin allows you to control the server via a **web interface** over HTTPS.
