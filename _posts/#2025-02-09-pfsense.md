1. Log in to the Proxmox web interface.
2. Click on the **Create VM** button in the top-right corner.
3. Configure the VM as follows:
   - **General**:
     - Name the VM (e.g., `pfSense`).
   - **OS**:
     - Select the uploaded pfSense ISO.
   - **System**:
     - BIOS: Default (SeaBIOS).
     - Machine: Default.
   - **Hard Disk**:
     - Allocate appropriate disk space (e.g., 10 GB).
   - **CPU**:
     - Assign at least 2 cores.
   - **Memory**:
     - Allocate 2 GB of RAM (or more based on your needs).
   - **Network**:
     - Add two network interfaces:
       - First for WAN (bridged to your physical NIC).
       - Second for LAN (internal network).
4. Click **Finish** to create the VM.

## üöÄ Step 3: Start the VM and Boot into pfSense

1. Select the newly created VM from the Proxmox interface.
2. Click **Start** and then **Console** to access the VM.
3. Follow the installation steps:
   - Accept the license agreement.

   - Configure the network interfaces:
     - Assign one NIC as WAN.
     - Assign the other NIC as LAN.
   - Finalize installation and set a strong admin password.

## üé® Step 4: Access the pfSense Web Interface

1. After the installation completes, note the LAN IP address displayed in the console (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
2. Open a web browser and navigate to `https://[LAN IP]`.
3. Log in using the default credentials:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `pfsense`
4. Complete the setup wizard to configure basic settings, such as:
   - Hostname and domain.
   - DNS servers.
   - WAN and LAN settings.
